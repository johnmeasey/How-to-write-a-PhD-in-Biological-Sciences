<h1 number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Reconciling yourself to doing things you’ve been avoiding</h1>
<p>Some 30 odd years ago as an undergraduate I was told that I would have to use computers in one of my 2nd year courses. The thought filled me with dread and I remember putting off going into the computer room for as long as I could. It was a steep learning curve, and I struggled. As my only previous experience had been with a typewriter, each time the cursor got to the end of the screen I hit the carriage return button. And each machine had an odd white device attached called a mouse, and I had no idea what that did. All this seems quite preposterous now, but imagine embarking on a PhD in biological sciences without reconciling yourself to using a PC. This is practically where we are now with R <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rcoreteam2021r" role="doc-biblioref">R Core Team 2021</a>)</span>, and indeed a wealth of other alternative programming platforms.</p>
<p>(ref:Rlogo) <strong>The ubiquitous R logo.</strong> R (and the invaluable GUI RStudio) has become the go to platform for many statistics and figures in biological sciences</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: centre">
<img src="figures/Rlogo.png" alt="(ref:Rlogo)" width="33%" />
<p class="caption">
(#fig:Rlogo)(ref:Rlogo)
</p>
</div>
<p>If you are not already aware of the prominence that R now has in conducting statistical analyses in biological sciences, then you’ve missed out on a great deal. The real point here is not that you can use R, but that R represents a platform on which analyses can be easily repeated, and by saving and making the code available, you are making your data analyses reproducible. We will see elsewhere the importance of reproducibility in sciences <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-baker20161500" role="doc-biblioref">Baker 2016</a>)</span>, and the critical role this has in transparency and therefore best practice.</p>
<p>What is perhaps most remarkable about learning R is the freedom it gives you away from large amounts of commercial software. As a basic programming language it can be used for statistical analysis, drawing figures, conducting geographic information system (GIS) level work, and even as a word processor on which to write your thesis <span class="citation">(and indeed this book <a href="#ref-xie2016bookdown" role="doc-biblioref">Xie 2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>If you already know all of the above, then you won’t face any major barriers, and you will fit into the new and more transparent world of science with great ease. If the thought of using R fills you with dread, in the same way that using a computer did some 30 years ago, then you should reconcile yourself now before you go any further. Learning R will be a steep learning curve, but it will be made easier by the large amount of excellent video tutorials and online courses that are available.</p>
<div id="and-learning-lots-of-other-stuff" class="section level2" number="2.1">
<h2 number="2.1"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> And learning lots of other stuff…</h2>
<p>The same principle that I’ve written about above can be extended to all sorts of other aspects of your PhD project. You will have to learn new skills, and some of these will be things that you have previously resisted having to do. Allow yourself to be open to all aspects of learning, and all skills. The act of learning opens new pathways in your brain, and using this ‘muscle’ will facilitate future learning exercises.</p>

<div id="nohypothesis" class="section level1" number="7">
<h1 number="7"><span class="header-section-number">7</span> What happens if you don’t have a hypothesis?</h1>
<p>So far we have concentrated on thesis chapters or manuscripts that have hypotheses to test. I have emphasised that there is a need to focus all of the sections of your writing to helping frame and understand the hypothesis (in the Introduction), explain your approach in collecting and testing the variables (in the Materials and Methods), provide the results of your tests (in the Results), and respond to the hypothesis (in the Discussion) together with placing it in context. But what, I hear you cry, if you don’t have a hypothesis to test?</p>
<p>There are lots of reasons why manuscripts don’t have hypotheses, and the chances are that in a PhD thesis (for example) you will have at least one chapter where there isn’t a hypothesis tested. So, given all the emphasis above, what can be done?</p>
<div id="central-problematic" class="section level2" number="7.1">
<h2 number="7.1"><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Central problematic</h2>
<p>If you have a particular problem that your research is trying to solve, this may result in a new methodology or perspective rather than testing a hypothesis. This work is still suitable for a journal manuscript (and there are specific journals dedicated to new methodologies). Instead of introducing your hypothesis, you can simply introduce the problem that your methodology applies to. A new methodology will probably best fill an existing gap, and so your introduction will likely point out what this gap is, provide evidence for why existing methodologies don’t fill the gap, and outline the variables in your novel approach.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you have a question but not a hypothesis, that your research tries to answer, you can take exactly the same approach to introduce your question.</p>
<p>Hence, no matter what your central problem is, you still need to identify this and put it at the heart of your manuscript so that all of your sections address this point. Of course, there may be more than one, and if so you will need to clearly articulate each one and explain how they are related to each other. If you are unsure about how to move forward, the best thing to do is to look to the literature for other examples of what you’re trying to do. Someone has very likely done something similar before. Don’t forget to chat about it with your advisor, as they may have ideas about where to look.</p>
</div>
<div id="does-it-matter-that-you-dont-have-a-hypothesis" class="section level2" number="7.2">
<h2 number="7.2"><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Does it matter that you don’t have a hypothesis?</h2>
<p>Having a hypothesis makes your work stronger than if you only have a question or prediction. In each case, while your results might help answer your question or confirm your prediction, they won’t test the mechanism (so that you can’t explain why you have the results that you do), and they may not be falsifiable/refutable. Of course, Popper would argue that if you don’t have a null hypothesis, then your methodology isn’t scientific.</p>
<p>To me, it is important for you to know exactly what your study is before you start writing about it, or even before you do the experiments. It is essential for you to frame the context of your study. The central reason why you are writing the study will lie at the heart of the manuscript. In the formulaic approach, it will be verbalised at the end of the introduction. All parts of the methodology will explain how you approached this central aim. So if you can’t pin down what this is, then make sure you discuss it with your advisor.</p>
</div>
<div id="avoid-harking" class="section level2" number="7.3">
<h2 number="7.3"><span class="header-section-number">7.3</span> Avoid HARKing</h2>
<p>Hypothesising After Results are Known (HARKing) is the practice of creating your hypothesis once the results are in and you’ve done some preliminary data analyses to see what is significant <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-forstmeier2017detecting" role="doc-biblioref">Forstmeier, Wagenmakers, and Parker 2017</a>)</span>. HARKing has become prevalent in science because of the confirmation bias by journals (only accepting papers that can statistically accept the alternative hypothesis), especially those with higher impact factor. Increasing chances of confirmation bias, or a <a href="TypeI.html">Type I error</a>, is not desirable as you are more likely to accept the alternative hypothesis when it is not correct. Alternatively you should seriously consider <a href="transparency.html">preregistering your aims</a> to remain transparent.</p>

<div id="voice" class="section level1" number="19">
<h1 number="19"><span class="header-section-number">19</span> When is it possible to retain your own voice when writing?</h1>
<p>Should one use “I” or “we” when writing a scientific paper? Although there was a tradition not to use first-person pronouns when writing scientific articles, this has fallen by the wayside in recent years, because the use of I or we makes writing simpler for writers and easier to understand for readers. Use “I” if you are the sole author (or in your thesis) and “we” for two or more authors.</p>
<p>You will regularly see “I” or “we” being used in the last paragraph of the introduction and the first paragraph of the discussion. It’s also quite common to use this in the methods section. The reason why these sections have “I” or “we” is quite obvious, as it allows you to place your own voice on your actions and decisions. After all, it is your aim and hypothesis for your study, so you should own it. Using first-person pronouns also allows you to be more concise, and there are some great examples given by Kurt Vonnegut <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-vonnegut1980how" role="doc-biblioref">1980</a>)</span> where you can see what happens when you don’t use them.</p>
<p>The first use of “I” or “we” at the end of the introduction is powerful. Up to that point, the reader has read four or five paragraphs of logical arguments outlining the background information that makes up the reasoning for your study. Using the first-person pronoun now makes the reader sit up as they have you communicating directly with them what you aimed to do. But that power is lost with repetition. So if you were to continuously use it throughout the methodology, the reader may get tired of reading a string of statements stating that you did this, then you did that, and so on. The power of using “I” or “we” is to use it sparingly to boost clarity.</p>
<div id="does-writing-i-or-we-help-people-to-understand-who-you-are" class="section level2" number="19.1">
<h2 number="19.1"><span class="header-section-number">19.1</span> Does writing “I” or “we” help people to understand who you are?</h2>
<p>Actually, all of your writing will do this. As long as you are using your own words (and not plagiarising), your writing is likely to be unique to you and hence recognisable as you. It never ceases to amaze me that it is possible to convey the same information in so many different ways. Your way will likely change with time and experience, but remain yours throughout your writing life. If you keep writing, people will be able to recognise your distinct style.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-vonnegut-advice" class="section level2" number="19.2">
<h2 number="19.2"><span class="header-section-number">19.2</span> The Vonnegut advice</h2>
<p>Kurt Vonnegut <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-vonnegut1980how" role="doc-biblioref">1980</a>)</span>, infamous novelist, provided some advice for writers. First, he made an impassioned plea for technical writers (yes, you) to use your own writing style. The easiest way, Vonnegut argues, is to write about a subject that you care about. He’s totally correct on this, and I’m hoping that after all your research you care passionately about your subject. Next, not to ramble, but to keep your writing simple.</p>
<p>What is most impressive about Vonnegut’s advice is that he argues from the readers’ standpoint. His parting advice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our audience requires us to be sympathetic and patient teachers, ever willing to simplify and clarify - whereas we would rather soar high above the crowd, singing like nightingales.”</p>
<p>— Kurt Vonnegut <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-vonnegut1980how" role="doc-biblioref">1980</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having said that you should write about subjects that you feel passionately about, this does not mean that you should write with unsubstantiated passion. For example, it makes no sense to write: “The threats to this spectacular species surpass any mechanism known to humankind” …unless you have substantive citations or results to back this up. Yes, it’s passionate, but that should be balanced by the need to keep what you write factual.</p>

<p>It can be really tough to get started writing especially if you are writing in English as a foreign language. It could be that the academic phrasebank is just what you’re looking for.</p>
<p>When reading papers, I often come across the same phrases time and again. They seem so well honed to the situation that I’m envious about how the writer dreamt them up. Stealing them isn’t quite <a href="plagiarism.html">plagiarism</a>, but then they don’t regularly fit the exact situation that I’m looking for.</p>
<p>Imagine cutting and pasting them into a file, or even better a database that’s ready for any eventuality. Banking them over time so that they are always available.</p>
<p>Then imagine that you did this and made it available to everyone…
<a href="http://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/" class="uri">http://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/</a></p>
<p>Well, John Morley has already done it, and he’s made it available to everyone. The academic phrasebank is a fantastic resource:</p>

<h2 number="23.1"><span class="header-section-number">23.1</span> How to find the phrase that you need:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Look across the top for different sections of text that you are currently writing.</li>

<div id="getting-started" class="section level2" number="23.2">
<h2 number="23.2"><span class="header-section-number">23.2</span> Getting started</h2>
<p>It strikes me that this is going to be a fantastic resource for those of you who are not writing in English as your home language. And for those of you who just need a few words to get started. It’ll also be useful when you are wanting to wordsmith your introduction or abstract.</p>
<p>Is it plagiarism? Given that the chapter before is all about not copying and pasting, am I now telling you that it’s ok to copy and paste? Most of these phrases are less than five words or you will find that they are non-consecutive parts of a sentence. I don’t think that most of these would constitute plagiarism if you pasted them into your document. However, I would suggest that you spend some time refining what you’ve written and that when you do that, some of these phrases may then come out.</p>

<p>Once you’ve read and revised the draft text three times yourself, and you feel that you can’t really improve it any more, hand it over. Personally, I need to wait a day or more between drafts when I work on something else, or do some reading. I find that it really helps to think about writing while not writing. Run through the arguments in your head when you are doing something else. That could be time in the gym, out running, cycling or swimming. Or talk through the logic of your argument with a friend or colleague while having coffee. You’ll find that spending time thinking away from sitting in front of your word-processor will be really valuable in promoting productivity once you sit down again.</p>
<p>If possible, hand it to an office mate or other friend first. Your reader shouldn’t have to be an expert in your field, but only needs to have a loose grasp on scientific writing to follow any paper. As a guide, any recent graduate of a biological sciences degree (BSc) should be able to understand. This makes it easy to find lots of potential readers for your manuscript before handing it in.</p>
<p><strong>In summary</strong></p>
<p>Writing a paper as a formula is not the only way of writing a scientific manuscript, but it has two really important qualities which I recommend:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>it makes writing easier, and</li>
<li>readers will be familiar with the style and this will help them understand your work.</li>

<div id="data" class="section level1" number="32">
<h1 number="32"><span class="header-section-number">32</span> Data Management</h1>
<p>Almost everyone has had the experience of having written some really excellent work, and then had some terrible technology malfunction meaning that they lose everything. Some failure to backup stories are truly horrific. However, they all represent a failure on the part of the person involved to properly backup their work.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, it is very easy to keep copies of documents on the cloud, or even write straight onto the cloud. Talk to your advisor about what options are available in your institution for backing up your work. Make a plan early on, before you start with your study, and then stick with that backup plan as you move through your PhD. A really good option is to start working in one of the Open Science platforms. For example, OSF allows you to create a project where you can continue to use lots of different cloud based resources, and provides an integrated home for them (for an introductory video see here). OSF is also a great platform as it is free to use, and as long as individual files are less than 5 Gb, OSF will host them. This means that for most projects, raw data files can be stored on the cloud at no cost to the project.</p>
<div id="should-the-cloud-be-the-only-copy-of-your-data" class="section level2" number="32.1">
<h2 number="32.1"><span class="header-section-number">32.1</span> Should the cloud be the only copy of your data?</h2>
<p>No. I suggest that you keep a hard drive with a copy of your data that you regularly deposit on a monthly basis, or after significant bouts of data collection such as field trips or experiments. A hard drive has the advantage that in the case of an internet outage, you always have access to your data.</p>
<p>Don’t try to store data on a laptop or desktop computer. These are for working files only. Backup is a separate operation where you store files. While computers are good for computation, they are frail and much more likely to suffer from catastrophic failures. They are also objects that are prone to being stolen.</p>
</div>
<div id="backing-up-in-the-field" class="section level2" number="32.2">
<h2 number="32.2"><span class="header-section-number">32.2</span> Backing up in the field</h2>
<p>If you are going to be doing lots of field work, then you might want to make a specific plan about backing up data to the cloud during the field time. It may seem expensive, but I’m sure that it won’t be as expensive as losing the data. Alternatively, or in addition, you may want to take a portable storage option.</p>
<p>I still prefer field notes and data to be written into a book (preferably with waterproof paper such as <a href="https://www.riteintherain.com/">rite in the rain</a>). This allows you to make a photographic backup of the hard copy. Similarly, you can design datasheets that you use in the field with a pencil, and then photograph them to make a hard copy. I don’t like entering data directly into a laptop or other device. For me, the advantage is that it is too easy to mis-type a data point into a device, and then there is no record about what it should have been. These days there are multiple different ways to enter data into devices (including dictation), and so you should make your own plan about what you feel most comfortable with. If you do make a hard copy, you will then have to transcribe it later. If you make mistakes, you can go back to the hard copy.</p>

<h2 number="32.3"><span class="header-section-number">32.3</span> Make a data management plan, and stick to it</h2>
<p>However you decide to manage your data, make sure that you have a plan and that you stick to it. Don’t become a victim of some unexpected event that will lose your data. These events will still happen, but at least your existing data will be safe. Creating a secure data management plan (Figure @ref(fig:Data-management)) is something that you should design and then talk through with your advisor. There is much more to data management than simply backing up your data. A great start is to read through the <a href="https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/BES-Guide-Data-Management-2019.pdf">British Ecological Society’s guide to Data Management</a>. <a href="SuppInfo.html">See part 3</a> for information about how to archive and distribute your data.</p>
<p>(ref:Data-management) <strong>The data management cycle.</strong> It is possible to see your data as a cycle between creation and distribution. Your plan should aim to cover each of these steps (redrawn from the British Ecological Society’s guide to Data Management).</p>

<p>You probably won’t be able to think about all the potential pitfalls that may happen during your PhD, but if there are some obvious ones, then do consider them and see whether you can mitigate the circumstances should they occur.</p>

There are registers of funders, and you should use to see whether your funder is present and exactly how they should be acknowledged. One example is the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/">Crossref Funder Registry</a>.

<li>Organisations that gave you permission to do your work. In some journals the acknowledgements is the correct place to put your permit numbers along with the names of the organisations who provided them.</li>
<li>Increasingly, permission from ethics committees is placed in the materials and methods but do check with the journal instructions to authors.</li>
<li>People who supplied you with samples, images or other elements of your work or presentation of your manuscript.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many journals have specific ways in which they want people’s names to be written. You will need to follow the guidelines. For example, authors are often referred to by their initials in the acknowledgements. This is useful when some people in your paper need to thank particular funding bodies who didn’t fund others.
Thank anyone who gave you a photograph that you used in the paper.</p>

<ul>
<li>You do not need to thank anyone who is an author. The exception is in your thesis acknowledgements, where you should mention them and their support.</li>
<li>Personally, I tend not to thank people who were paid to do a specific job and only did that job. The acknowledgements is a section to name people who have gone out of their way to help you.</li>
<li>Your family for getting you to grad school (unless they really helped you do the work). However, in your thesis acknowledgements, you should absolutely include your family.</li>
</ul>
<p>If in doubt it’s probably a good idea to be as inclusive as you can in the acknowledgements.</p>
<p>If in doubt with the acknowledgements refer to other acknowledgement sections in the same journal and see how they are formatted and written. Remember that if your journal is conducting double-blind review, they may ask for the acknowledgements (and the title page) to be removed from the main manuscript and uploaded separately.</p>

<h1 number="41"><span class="header-section-number">41</span> Tables</h1>
<p>If you think that tables are just about displaying a series of boring numbers, then it’s time to free your mind. Tables are an amazing vehicle to display information that can be numeric, written or pictorial. From the simplest of two by two tables with several levels of organisation, the reason for putting your information in a table is that you can provide it in a simpler and easier way to the reader than if you were to put all the information in full into a paragraph of text. There are few rules on Tables, but you’ll find some guidelines in this Table @ref(tab:tables).</p>
<p>Most journals want tables formatted so that there are only horizontal lines. This makes them easier to print, but it can make following text across a large table difficult. Shading every other row really helps with this, and if you have the option of using this in your thesis then I’d recommend it.</p>
<p>As a biologist, I first started to use tables to provide large quantities of numbers. Tables of morphological measurements or meristics (counts). These were always tricky to put together in word processors, until they became better integrated with spreadsheets, and now it’s really easy to put these tables together and even format them in a spreadsheet and then cut and paste them into your word processor.</p>

<h2 number="44.2"><span class="header-section-number">44.2</span> There has been a big movement toward transparency and repeatability of scientific studies</h2>
<p>This is a really positive movement in science and it should receive all of our support as it is part of the greater scientific project <a href="transparency.html">see part 2</a>. Being proud of your work is being proud of the entire product, including the data and the analysis. If you felt they were good enough for peer review, then you should be happy to make them all freely available. Not sure if you haven’t made some mistakes? We all make mistakes and you shouldn’t think that you will have an entirely fault free career. Whenever and wherever possible conduct your professional due diligence and be open and honest with your research. Science is a career when we should welcome errors and mistakes that we have made in the past. There’s no problem with this. Indeed, the problems only start when you refuse to acknowledge past errors and mistakes, making you prone to motivated reasoning and confirmation bias.</p>
<p>There are lots of data repositories out there. Some specialise in particular kinds of data, like genetic data in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/">GenBank</a>, or sound data in <a href="https://www.macaulaylibrary.org/">The Macaulay Library</a> at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Others are general repositories of data and you can post anything there, including the scripts that you used to analyse the data. By doing this you ensure that any people that want to use your work in the future have full access to it. Your data deposit will be given a DOI. You can use this DOI in your publication so that readers know where to find the data.</p>
<p>Once I happily allowed the publishers to store my data. These days, I simply don’t trust them to curate and keep my data for posterity. The way that most publishers of academic journals behave, there is no reason for them to make sure that my data is safe and secure. Therefore, I would rather go to an independent curator of data that specialises in not-for-profit data curation. One example is <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a> which is built and operated by CERN and OpenAIRE. This site has the advantage that it is integrated with GitHub (if you are already a user, but check it out if you aren’t). You can choose to open your data immediately, or embargo it until your paper is published. It’s a great platform, and so much more secure than using a publisher. Another example is the <a href="https://osf.io/">Open Science Framework (OSF)</a> that aims to be a one stop shop for all of your storage needs. OSF best practices can be found here. You will need to make sure that your data is correctly sorted with sufficient metadata for someone else to understand <span class="citation">(see <a href="#ref-roche2015public" role="doc-biblioref">Roche et al. 2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Once we did statistical analysis with a GUI and a point and click approach. Forget to click a checkbox and the results were not repeatable. As the analyses have become increasingly sophisticated with more and differing pieces of software, it is becoming increasingly important to record the code that you write that gets your results together with your data. This is the difference between making your results and therefore your study repeatable.</p>
<p>Talk to your advisor. Your lab or your institution may have a repository that they prefer.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-stop-with-just-depositing-your-data-and-analyses-online" class="section level2" number="44.3">
<h2 number="44.3"><span class="header-section-number">44.3</span> Why stop with just depositing your data and analyses online?</h2>
<p>Let’s face it, you probably put a lot of effort into proposing your thesis hypotheses. Why not deposit this too? Remember that it does not have to be accessible to the world, but it would improve the integrity of your study if your original hypotheses are the same as the ones that you submit for publication. Some journals are now asking whether you have stored hypotheses ahead of conducting the experiments. They don’t stop you from submitting if you haven’t. But why not? It’s a great step forward in terms of transparency and provides more credibility when you eventually write that manuscript with the same aims. And it shouldn’t stop you from publishing another study that happened along the way, even though you hadn’t planned it. I suspect that in future funders will require us to deposit our successful funding proposals in an online repository before they release funds - hopefully they’ll also be willing to support these facilities financially.</p>

<div id="part4" class="section level1" number="45">
<h1 number="45"><span class="header-section-number">45</span> Now that you have finished your data chapters</h1>
<p>In this last part of the book, I am going to presume that you have done all of the work for the data chapters, and written them up as distinct chapters of your thesis.
When you look at PhDs that are stored in your institutions libraries, or those that you’ve referred to in the course of your study, you will notice that they have two additional chapters in addition to data chapters. These are often quite short (although lengths vary), and serve to introduce and conclude the PhD thesis (Figure @ref(fig:thesis-construction)). While these are not usually considered to be the ‘meat’ of the PhD itself, they are important sections to reflect on and carefully consider, as they attempt to pull together data chapters that are written as stand-alone documents into a cohesive thesis. To this end, they require the same careful planning that any other section in your thesis deserves, with one important condition: that they should not impede the timely submission of your thesis.</p>
<p>(ref:thesis-construction) <strong>A typical construction of the data chapters in your thesis together with a introduction and conclusion.</strong> The exact construction of your thesis may vary, especially with the number of data chapters that you have. The relationship between thesis chapters may also not be linear as presented here.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>At this point, we have to acknowledge that different institutions require different deadlines of their students in order to finish their PhD studies and submit their theses for examination. In most institutions (to my knowledge) the time to submission is the most important, and can vary between 3 and 5 years (most institutions stipulate a minimum period of 2 years and some have no maximum duration). This period is critical with respect to funding. If funding ceases and your institution allows you to continue your studies, you may have to raise the funding to pay fees as well as to maintain your living costs. After submission there will be a period of time while your thesis is in examination, and another period before the final graduation. Each of these milestones comes with its own set of deadlines and conditions. It is well worth being aware of all these issues well in advance of any submission deadline (ask your advisor). Important aspects for you to note are whether or not you need to remain registered at your institution after you have submitted your thesis, and whether or not your institution will require payment for your registration.</p>
<p>Whatever your deadlines are will dictate how much time (and energy) you have to devote to the opening and closing chapters of your thesis. They can become publishable in their own right, or at the bare minimum, they can serve to allow you to submit a completed thesis. Here I will focus on the latter, minimum requirement (in my eyes), with the understanding that you should dedicate as much time as you have available to produce a quality product that you can feel proud of.</p>
<p>The next chapters deal with writing the <a href="PhDintro.html">introductory chapter</a>, the <a href="PhDconc.html">concluding chapter</a>, and then finally <a href="formatting.html">formatting your thesis for submission</a>. These final hurdles require some time and thought. Given that not all of you will have all of the time that you need, this is often the time when the demand on your writing skills reaches a peak. If you are in this position, I urge you to use your time wisely and to plan carefully what you will write.</p>

<h1 number="47"><span class="header-section-number">47</span> How to conclude your PhD</h1>
<p>By the time you come to write your concluding chapter of your PhD, you should have written all of the <a href="part3.html">data chapters</a> and the <a href="PhDintro.html">introductory chapter</a>. Firstly, I should congratulate you for getting this far. You’ve almost finished, and there’s just one final push required to complete the document. You are now the best placed person to tell yourself what should be in the concluding chapter.</p>
<div id="using-the-funnel-structure" class="section level2" number="47.1">
<h2 number="47.1"><span class="header-section-number">47.1</span> Using the funnel structure</h2>
<p>In principle, you can use the same funnel structure that we described for the <a href="discussion.html">discussion</a> as a way of structuring your concluding chapter (see figure @ref(fig:discussion)). This would include starting with a synopsis of what your thesis is trying to achieve. Clearly, this starting section may be more than a paragraph (as it was in the <a href="part3.html">data chapters</a>), and the precise structure will be dictated by the complexity of your thesis structure (Figure @ref(fig:thesis-construction)).</p>
</div>
<div id="what-to-include-in-the-concluding-chapter" class="section level2" number="47.2">
<h2 number="47.2"><span class="header-section-number">47.2</span> What to include in the concluding chapter?</h2>
<p>I suggest that you take your conceptual outline (from the <a href="PhDintro.html">introductory chapter</a>), and use this to being thinking about how best to construct the outline of your concluding chapter. If your data chapters are used to feed into a final output, then consider using the approach of a <a href="argument.html">logical argument</a> as the outline.</p>
<p>The main body should review the concluding findings of each of the data chapters, and especially the way in whcih they interact - as these are the aspects that are least likely to have been touched on already in the individual data chapters. It is hoped that the thesis represents a body of work, and not a series of unconnected works. Thus your task in this final chapter is to present to the examiner (and any other reader) exactly how the chapters fit together into a body of work.</p>
<p>Your concluding chapter should provide all of the highlights and insights that have been gained from your PhD thesis. It is unlikely to you need to dwell on individuals caveats from the chapters, unless there are general caveats from your approach that span chapters - in which case these probably deserve attention.</p>
<p>Your concluding chapter will cite the data chapters of your thesis quite heavily, as it essentially pulls them all together, along with the objectives that they aimed to achieve, in the overarching concepts of your study area.</p>
<p>You also have an opportunity to point to where, in your opionion, the direction of your particular field should move next. <strong>Do provide your opinion</strong>. Remember that you are now one of the most qualified people in this particular area to be pronouncing on what should be done. Your opinion is therefore valid, and your concluding chapter is a good place to provide a reasoned argument about your own ideas.</p>
</div>
<div id="concluding-section" class="section level2" number="47.3">
<h2 number="47.3"><span class="header-section-number">47.3</span> Concluding section</h2>
<p>Your PhD may not have one overriding simple conclusion, indeed it will likely not have, so don’t try to force one if there isn’t one. Instead, attempt to sum up your findings in a way that explains how they have added to and changed the existing body of knowledge in your subject area.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered">The obligation to publish your work</h1>
<p>Now that you’ve submitted your PhD, you need still need to do something with it. For most of you this will be publishing it in a journal of your choice. It will then take you through what happens to the manuscript and give you insight about where you might want to publish, how to choose the journal. Publication is important. Here is a list of reasons why you have some obligation to publish the work in your thesis:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your work is unpublished, then it will not be used. Without use, all the work that you put into it falls away.</li>
<li>Your published work will become the foundation for future students and academics who are active in your field. This might well be in another country or on another continent.</li>
<li>Your work was most likely paid for by tax-payers in the country where you studied. Publishing this work is a way of handing back the value of what you found. If it is published Open Access, the public can also read it for themselves.</li>
<li>Other funders of your thesis work may have made publication a prerequisite of the funding criteria.</li>
<li>It is hoped that by publishing your work it will become more accessible to the scientific community.</li>
<li>By publishing your work you will find that both you, and your work, become known by an international community that may well invite you to participate in the academic process further <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-marks2013misuse" role="doc-biblioref">Marks et al. 2013</a>)</span>.</li>
<li>Both inside and outside of science as a career, peer reviewed published papers are seen as an important accomplishment in addition to the production of your thesis.</li>
<li>The work that you have already put into your thesis (especially if you have followed the advice in this book!), will mean that you are close to having chapters that can be submitted as publications.</li>
<li>Your advisor and lab colleagues who helped with your thesis work may depend on your publications.</li>
<li>There is a lot of satisfaction to be had by seeing your work published. It has been argued that this depends on who you are and where you come from <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-husemann2017publicationism" role="doc-biblioref">Husemann et al. 2017</a>)</span>.</li>
<li>The satisfaction of having someone say how enjoyable or inspiring your work is to read will certainly not be as frequent as if you managed to publish a novel or newspaper column. But when it does happen, it will bring a smile to your face.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is by no means an exhaustive list, but I hope it will give you some insight into the importance of publishing your results. To counter this assertion, please be aware that there is also research that suggests that publication driven science is not healthy, and that we need a new way to motivate science <span class="citation">(e.g. <a href="#ref-stergiou2014impact" role="doc-biblioref">Stergiou and Lessenich 2014</a>)</span>. Indeed, it has been suggested that the ‘publish or perish’ mentality of academia has resulted in the retention (and even deterioration) of poor experimental design, and hence higher false positives in the behavioural sciences <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-smaldino2016natural" role="doc-biblioref">Smaldino and McElreath 2016</a>)</span>. However, before you can join the debate about the future, I’d argue that you need to provide your credentials for the present.</p>
<p>Taking your work to the next level is not a trivial step, even though you already have your chapters written in the style of manuscripts. The challenges of publishing work, like other challenges in academia, are much easier if you possess inside knowledge of the system. The demystification of the next steps along the road in academia are the subject of another book:</p>

<p>I really hope that this book has been helpful and that it has achieved what I set out to do: provide you with the guide on how to write a PhD in biological sciences. If you feel that this book has important items missing, out-of-date or simply wrong, then please help. Any good guide relies upon the people that use it to keep it viable.</p>
<p>If you have found this book useful, then please remember that you can contribute to the project at the Github pages for this book, using bookdown. If your contributions, no matter how small, improve the book, then you will be improving the experience of doing a PhD in Biological Sciences for future PhD students, and that has to be worth something.</p>
<p>Remember that there is another book that starts off where this book ends: from thesis chapters to published papers. It also tackles some of the broader issues within academia, which are likely to be relevant if you are planning your career in this area.</p>
