\chapter*{Welcome}\label{welcome}}


Welcome to this guide on how to write a PhD in biological sciences. I will not tell you what to write. My intention is to tell you how to approach writing with respect to style, format and formula (planning).

Writing a PhD is a daunting prospect. One does not put pen to paper, or, rather, finger to keyboard, only after finishing all of your experiments and/or labwork. Writing is actually something you should start from day one of your PhD, or even before day one, when you make the first initial pitch of big ideas to your advisor on what you want to do. If you can find the discipline to start writing from day one, then you are much more likely to make a much better go of it than waiting until the final, pressured, stretch. But to do this, you need to understand how to write a PhD thesis. You need to understand what you are aiming to achieve, and, crucially, you need to understand why you are doing your PhD.

This guide intends to demystify the writing process so that the eventual goal is clear, and provide the necessary information on how to get there. It takes you from those initial ideas, all the way through proposal writing, posing hypotheses, testing them, and then how to write it all up.

This book started as a series of blog posts written by me for my students (john.measey.com/blog). I wrote them because I felt that I was repeating the same advice year after year. Instead of rewriting comments on manuscripts time after time, I thought I would consolidate them and put them all in one place. Later, I started looking for particular problems that students were having, and then writing blog posts to try to preempt those problems, and to provide solutions before tasks were completed. Finally, I have tried to fill in the missing gaps in the blog posts. But there are still plenty of gaps, and I regard this book as a work-in-progress. It is my intention that this book will always be added to, and improved by a community of practice, and I hope that this will include you.

\hypertarget{why-read-this-book}{%
\section*{Why read this book}\label{why-read-this-book}}


Embarking on a PhD is intimidating as, for most students, it will be their first experience working within the academic system. The voyage of discovery is often made very frustrating as much of what goes on in academia is assumed knowledge. Academics accumulate knowledge throughout their careers, but what can be done for those who are uninitiated? What is needed is a guide. In the same way that we had guides to foreign countries and cities, postgraduate students need a guide that newcomers can refer to before, during and when making decisions about their time within academia. Note that this is not a rulebook. There are times when the guide will be accurate and others when it will be vague, but providing some insight to point you in directions where you can explore more.

\hypertarget{structure-of-the-book}{%
\section*{Structure of the book}\label{structure-of-the-book}}


This book is intended to be a guide. Don't sit down and read it from cover to cover. If you do, then I think you have likely misunderstood what this guide is for. Instead, I want you to think about this book as a guide much in the same way that you might pick up a guide to a foreign city, country or even like Douglas Adams' fabled electronic guide \emph{The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy} \citet{adams2017ultimate} (if you are not familiar \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker\%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy}{see here}). However, instead of having hostels or restaurants recommended by name with a description of what makes them particularly praiseworthy, this guide provides a generic idea of what such places are for, what they tend to be like, the best ways to get to them, and pitfalls to avoid.

None of the topics is explored in any great depth. This is deliberate as this guide is here to provide you with a starting point for you to explore if you think it is necessary. I have provided literature (where possible), and you should use this in the standard way to research the topic yourself should you need or want to know any more. In the same way, none of the advice provided in this book should override what you decide for yourself or with your advisor. Take your decisions from an informed position.

\textbf{The book is divided into three main parts:}

\href{part1.html}{\textbf{Part 1}}
Part one is written as something that you should read early on in the process, once you've committed to doing a PhD. This shortest section of the book deals with what a PhD is, how it's examined, with whom, where and when to do it. At the start of your PhD is the time to be thinking of the bigger questions both in your study area, and your life, and this section provides some pointers and things to consider.

\href{part2.html}{\textbf{Part 2}}\\
Part two of the book sets out a practical guide to getting started with writing. The approach I've taken here is describing the production of a PhD in biological sciences which is made up of data chapters, and where each chapter is essentially a potential publication in a science journal. If you didn't want to do a PhD but just wanted to write a publication, then most of what is here (and in Part 3) will be of use as you could take the same formulaic approach as given in this book. Similarly, if you were writing a MSc project, this section would also be useful. There is a lot of technical stuff involved in writing science, and in part 2 I cover as much as I can while still remaining general to the subject area.

\href{part3.html}{\textbf{Part 3}}
A typical PhD will consist of five data chapters where each data chapter is a publication. There is a shortish introductory chapter (sometimes a literature review) that comes before these data chapters, and a concluding synthesis chapter at the end. That's not to say that this is the only way of writing a PhD. There are many different ways and it is a good idea for you and your advisor to talk about this together before you start.

This part covers how to write the core sections of a paper: abstract, introduction, methods and materials, results, discussion and references.

Throughout this guide you will find links and references of things to read elsewhere. The reality is that there is a lot out there for you to read. I am not the only person to write a guide, and I can't pretend that all the answers are here in this book. You will find that in your particular situation you need to look around. What I aim to do in this book is provide you with enough background information to help in your onward search, and provide you with enough inside knowledge to do a PhD.

\hypertarget{why-a-guide-for-the-uninitiated}{%
\section*{Why `A guide for the uninitiated'?}\label{why-a-guide-for-the-uninitiated}}


I think that most people with doctorates would agree that a PhD is not awarded to people because they are particularly bright or smart. If you had to be a genius then I wouldn't have a PhD. Indeed, I don't consider myself to be particularly clever, but I worked very hard to get my PhD. I was hampered by the fact that I didn't know anything about the goals and aims of the academic process of working towards a PhD, so it took a lot more work, wasted time, and (let's not mince our words) real pain. The end product was a fraction of the potential that I could have achieved, if I had understood more about the process. If I had only had a guide to tell me what it was all about, I could have saved myself so much time and energy. In short, I feel that I was uninitiated, and this is the guide I wish that I had had.

So, this guide is my practical attempt to help you to get the most that you can out of your PhD time. After all, it should be an amazing journey that culminates with you achieving academic maturity: the ability to conceive and carry out scientific investigations. When you have a PhD, you become a scientist. Too often, however, it's a nightmare journey of cul-de-sacs, and groping in the dark.

You should be aware from the outset that doing a PhD is a major undertaking. It will take several years of your life and will impact heavily on your day to day life, to the extent that your mental health may suffer. A PhD represents the culmination of an incredible amount of work, not to mention that you've already had to complete one to three previous degrees beforehand. It may not be something that you ever finish to your own satisfaction. But finish it you must.

\hypertarget{software-information-and-conventions}{%
\section*{Software information and conventions}\label{software-information-and-conventions}}


I used the \textbf{knitr}\index{knitr} package \citep{xie2015dynamic} and the \textbf{bookdown}\index{bookdown} package \citep{R-bookdown} to compile my book.

\hypertarget{acknowledgments}{%
\section*{Acknowledgments}\label{acknowledgments}}


Before I go on, there are a great many people that I need to thank. First and foremost are my students, past and present, who have inspired me to put together first the blog posts and then the book. It is because you wanted more that I put this together. I have also been a student, and have been inspired by colleagues around the world who have been exemplary advisors. This book contains lots of links to blogs and articles written and posted freely on the internet by others who also aim to demystify and help. I thank this greater academic community for sharing and inspiring. Thanks go to the many reviewers and editors who have taken their time to improve my writing. I am still learning. Lots of the text in this book has been improved by feedback from my students and postdocs. A special mention must go to my brother, Richard, who has hosted my lab website for more than a decade, and especially for saving blog posts from hacking attacks. Thanks also to my wife, Thalassa, who proofread many of the blog posts after I had published them late at night, so that I could correct them over breakfast in the morning. James Baxter-Gilbert, Anthony Herrel, Lisa O'Connell, Mark O'Connell, James Vonesh all read parts and commented. Thanks are also due to my colleagues at the Centre for Invasion Biology, the Department of Botany and Zoology, and Stellenbosch University. A special thanks to the librarians who have supported many of my more extreme rantings about publishers.

\hypertarget{contribute}{%
\chapter*{Do you have something to contribute?}\label{contribute}}


This book is written in bookdown \citep{xie2016bookdown} specifically to make it a `live project' that will be open to anyone who wants to contribute, improve, or use as the basis for your own book in a different language, or for a different region on the world. It would be impossible to cover every aspect of writing a PhD in Biological Sciences, and it may be that I have missed out ones that are very important to you. Equally, what is currently written will become obsolete very quickly as new initiatives are begun, and old problems are resolved. For this reason, this guide needs to be a `living document', and anyone who wants to provide feedback or contribute new sections is more than welcome. Please feel free to open an issue, or make a Pull Request if you spot a typo.

\hypertarget{intro}{%
\chapter{Introduction}\label{intro}}

Right from the very start of your PhD, it is important for you to become familiar with the goal of what you are trying to achieve, how you plan to achieve it, and (believe it or not) what you are going to do afterwards. There are a lot of things to think about as you start your PhD, and for many of these it is far easier to make the informed decisions from the outset. For example, reconciling yourself to using the statistical package R will be much easier from the start, rather than only realising under pressure at the end of your PhD that there is no way that you can finish unless you take it on. Getting, and staying in, the right mental framework will also be very important for your ability to work under pressure. Again, getting into good habits at the beginning will put you in a commanding position later.

\hypertarget{beforeyoustart}{%
\section{So you are doing a PhD?}\label{beforeyoustart}}

In this first chapter of the book I intend to make you familiar with what a PhD is, how to approach thinking about it, and what to look for in an institution and advisor. You may already have some or all of these things fixed, but there is still some use in going over these basic points. Try to keep an open mind. Doing a PhD will take several years of your life, and may well define your future career prospects. Therefore, to say that this is a big decision is an understatement. It is not a substitute for getting a job or a way of remaining a student for longer. If after reading this section you are in any doubt about whether or not a PhD is right for you, then I would suggest that you do need to think about it further. Don't take my word for it, go and talk to people who have done a PhD (whether or not they now have a job), or those who are doing a PhD now. Especially if their experience is in your focal research area, they are likely to know a lot more about it.

\hypertarget{what-is-a-phd}{%
\subsection{What is a PhD?}\label{what-is-a-phd}}

PhD comes from the Latin \emph{Philosophiae Doctor}, and means ``Doctor of Philosophy''. All doctorates derive from philosophy which is essentially the mother of all academic subjects.

Obtaining a PhD allows you to (legitimately) call yourself a Doctor, and/or put the letters PhD after your name. You likely already have other letters (BSc, MSc, etc.) after your name, so this won't be anything new). Becoming a Doctor is (in most parts of the world) the last step in your formal training as a researcher. However, in some countries (see list \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habilitation}{here}) a further process (Habilitation) is required to lead research groups and/or teach at universities (leading the way to a professorship).

PhDs are granted by universities (for the most part) and those are the institutions that set the standards. In many countries, these universities are required to meet the criteria of national bodies. Essentially, the top-down control is to ensure that the PhD qualification adheres to national and international standards. You may be aware that there are mutterings of whether qualifications are what they used to be. This has also been said of PhDs. However, I'm of the opinion that the standards are much as they were. You will really set the level on the bar of your own PhD. You either pass or fail. If your intention were to do the `bare minimum' required to get a PhD, then you would have to look carefully for an advisor that would be happy to preside over such a thesis. Suffice it to say that this would be a very poor place to start, and there may be lots of other reasons why doing a PhD really is not appropriate for you.

\hypertarget{is-a-phd-more-than-a-thesis}{%
\subsection{Is a PhD more than a thesis?}\label{is-a-phd-more-than-a-thesis}}

Yes. The thesis is really only the final evidence of all of the work and experience that you undertake while doing your PhD. The time that you spend doing your PhD will likely include participating in conferences, giving talks, participating in journal clubs, seminars, workshops and working groups. In addition to all of the writing skills, on which this book focuses, you will develop skills in techniques that relate to your particular area. You will also learn and develop your skills in presentation, analysis and treatment of data. It is an intense learning experience. It should also be a fun and positive experience.

While your PhD thesis will be a crucial and focal product of your PhD, and producing it will require a large amount of work, the thesis cannot be considered equivalent to the PhD.

Having said all of this, we have not really answered the question:

\textbf{What is a PhD?}

Because every PhD is different, it's quite a hard question to answer. Instead, I think that a better approach is to ask for the qualities that examiners are asked to assess when examining your PhD thesis. Again, this will be different in different institutions and countries. Some countries require an oral defence where a specialist jury is presented with the PhD dissertation and can grill the candidate for hours in public. Others, like my defense at Bristol University, happened behind closed doors with just two specialist examiners: an internal and an external.

\hypertarget{criteria-used-to-judge-phd-studies}{%
\subsection{Criteria used to judge PhD studies}\label{criteria-used-to-judge-phd-studies}}

In order to provide you with some general idea of what is required, I list below the (edited) questions asked of examiners for a PhD thesis by my university:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Has the motivation for the objectives of the study been formulated satisfactorily?
\item
  Do the research results constitute a meaningful contribution to the knowledge of and insight into the relevant field of study?
\item
  Does the dissertation distinguish clearly between own, new contributions to, and known results in the relevant field of study?
\item
  Is the candidate capable of evaluating the scientific meaning of his / her results and of placing this in context within existing knowledge in the field of study?
\item
  Does the candidate show signs of independent, critical thinking or other signs of originality?
\item
  Does the candidate show that they are sufficiently capable of doing independent research?
\item
  Does the dissertation show that the candidate is sufficiently familiar with the relevant research techniques and methods?
\item
  Does the dissertation show conversance with, and a critical attitude towards the pertinent literature?
\item
  Is the material presented in a clear, systematic and logical manner?
\item
  Is the linguistic, stylistic and technical editing of the dissertation acceptable?
\item
  Are the research results acceptable for publication?
\end{itemize}

If you compare these PhD requirements with those of an MSc, the key difference is that for a PhD you are required to produce a ``meaningful contribution to the knowledge of and insight into the relevant field of study'', and show that you are ``\ldots capable of doing independent research''. Thus, a PhD degree prepares you to be an independent researcher, and so you are expected to have a critical attitude toward other research.

\hypertarget{who-are-the-examiners}{%
\subsection{Who are the examiners?}\label{who-are-the-examiners}}

The next question to ask is who the examiners are? Again, different institutions will have different guidelines about who can be an examiner for a PhD. It is likely that most will agree that they should be holders of PhDs, in tenured positions (sometimes universities insist on full professorial appointments for examiners), and with experience of advising PhD students as well as having a proven record of their own publications. Hence, most PhD examiners will likely be senior academic figures. Their views are likely to have been informed by their own experience in academia, their own institutions and systems and prior experience of examining PhDs at other institutions.

I can tell you that many examiners will treat the exercise the same irrespective of the questions asked of them. They will treat the examination as an extra-large task in peer review. This is not unfair. Personally,
I think that there are some special extra hurdles required for a PhD (over and above 5 chapters that are publishable):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  First is the clear ability to conceptualise and carry out a body of scientific work that is novel. Here I mean novel in that it has not simply been a repeat of some previous work on a different taxon or system. This is easier to judge from an oral defense, over reading the thesis.
\item
  Second is the clear knowledge of how the work that is conducted fits into the bigger picture. That is that the work demonstrates that the person is a scientist at a broader level than the narrow focus of their research.
\item
  Third is whether the student has been able to bring the study together in a way that shows that it is more than the sum of its parts. In essence, together the 5 data chapters should provide a bigger overview of a broader topic, and show the direction of future work.
\end{itemize}

I prefer a thesis that fits together within a stated framework. I like PhD students to conceptualise how their chapters are interlinked, and to present this as a figure in the introduction of their proposal. A useful concept to be aware of is the `Hierarchy of Hypotheses' \citep{heger2018hierarchy}. In this approach, you are encouraged to consider the `bigger question' in your research area, identifying both what studies have produced evidence and identifying gaps from a theory driven approach. Generally, it is only possible to consider these types of concepts once you are familiar with the literature (both theoretical and experimental).

\hypertarget{what-will-you-do-after-your-phd}{%
\subsection{What will you do after your PhD?}\label{what-will-you-do-after-your-phd}}

It sounds silly to think about what comes after your PhD even as you are just starting, but the reality is that you always need to be planning ahead in order to make the most from what you are doing now. During your PhD you will have lots of opportunities in many different areas of academia, teaching and practically applied areas. Knowing what you want to do when you finish will help guide your decisions so that you can maximise opportunities as they arise. Both inside and outside of academia, it is likely to be the contacts that you make that will help in your next career move.

\hypertarget{doing-a-phd-actually-reduces-your-chance-of-employment-and-lowers-your-pay}{%
\subsubsection{Doing a PhD actually reduces your chance of employment and lowers your pay}\label{doing-a-phd-actually-reduces-your-chance-of-employment-and-lowers-your-pay}}

The reality is that most employers don't want someone with a PhD, because it is a very academic qualification. It will take you so far down an academic rabbit hole, that for an employer there's very little to use. Most employers want people who understand the nuts and bolts of doing research, but who can apply this knowledge outside of the academic system. Employers who want people with PhDs (and there are a few) generally want professional researchers who are essentially academics. Good work if you can get it, but it tends not to pay well. You might end up only being fit to be an academic, and that life is getting increasingly harder without any end to the expectations of the employers\ldots{} like the equivalent of doing a PhD every year. Something only very few people will enjoy.

At the same time, governments the world over, and especially developing countries, are providing bursaries for people to do PhDs. Why? The number of PhDs in a country is considered (by the \href{https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators}{World Bank}) to be one of many measures of the development of that country. As the percentage gets larger, so countries can convince the world bank that they are developing (and then get granted its favours, see Figure \ref{fig:PhDMap}). This is all well and good, but strategically, governments should consider why they want these researchers in their populations, and more particularly for what kinds of jobs. It seems somewhat unfair to produce lots of young PhD holders that have no careers to join, or prospects to use their PhD just so that your government can tick a check box on their road to development, and so borrow more money from the World Bank. If you are from a developing country, you cannot assume that just because you are given a bursary by your government it follows that they will give you a job or a career. This will likely always be your own task.

This ranges from 2.97\% in Switzerland (dark red) to 0.02\% in DR Congo (light yellow). Notably there is no data held in these years for many countries in Asia, Africa and South America.}\label{fig:PhDMap}
\end{figure}

In a recent report from the UK, it was found that by age 35, the earnings gap for those with PhDs was lower than the same cohort that left academia after their BSc or MSc \citep{britton2020earnings}. Women who obtain PhDs tend to increase their earnings by \textasciitilde8\%, while men \emph{reduce} their earnings by \textasciitilde9\%. However, for those in Biological Sciences women seem likely to earn no more than those with undergraduate degrees by age 35. Men earn around 10\% less. The point here is that you should not be doing a PhD in Biological Sciences because you think you will earn more money in your following career. Having made this point, I also feel that it is important to point out that how much you earn may not be directly related to job satisfaction or lifetime happiness. To my knowledge, this is not (yet) reported, but could be a lot higher for those with PhDs, even though they earn less.

It is important to realise that many academics are looking for good students to do PhD work. This is because they need someone to do research within their groups, and students or postdocs do most of this work. For this reason, an academic you know while you're doing your MSc studies may start to try to persuade you to do a PhD. This could be fantastic for you, it could be just what you're looking for. But the reality is that you will never do a PhD for somebody else, you are always going to be doing it for yourself. if the only reason you are doing a PhD is because someone else told you that you should then you are likely to have a really hard time. By the time you graduate, you may have a PhD but without any idea of what you're going to do with it.

\hypertarget{think-about-your-career-before-you-start-your-phd}{%
\subsection{Think about your career before you start your PhD}\label{think-about-your-career-before-you-start-your-phd}}

The last thing a PhD should be is a stop gap for you to fill your time because you can't think of anything else to do. Although this does sound ludicrous, there are many people in academia who did PhDs for this reason, or simply because they were offered an opportunity to do a PhD and felt that they couldn't turn it down.

You should be aware by now that there are lots of people in academia who are `institutionalised'. By this I mean that they have never had a job (or a life) outside of academia. This is not something that I can recommend for anyone. Such people are quite peculiar in many ways, and they tend to operate outside of the norms and standards of the rest of society. In particular, they make academia a more difficult place to work, because they tend to accentuate and maintain a lot of the silliness within these institutions. If you are worried about becoming such a person, then I think it would be advisable to take some time outside of academia. For example, if you have never worked but are thinking of doing a PhD, consider taking a year (or two) to do a job before starting a PhD. If it is in a related field it will likely help you greatly. I suggest that it will certainly help keep your feet on the ground, and in touch with some level of reality or normality, during your PhD. You'll also have some experience and connections to go back to once you've finished.

\hypertarget{dont-rely-on-becoming-an-academic}{%
\subsection{Don't rely on becoming an academic}\label{dont-rely-on-becoming-an-academic}}

Academia is getting more competitive. Whereas once it was almost certain that you would be employed as an academic after finishing your PhD, this is no longer the case. Indeed, the number of people who get PhDs is greatly increasing the world over, and most are in direct competition for a decreasing amount of academic posts. In 2019, 39\% of respondents to a survey said that the most important reason they decided to enrol in a PhD programme was to pursue an academic career \citep{woolston2019phds}. Further, 56\% wanted academia as their first choice for a career. Yet in Belgium, for example, the numbers of PhD graduates entering the market nearly doubled (in the first 15 years of the 21st century) while academic positions remained static \citep{levecque2017work}. Universities appear to be exploiting this excess of qualified people to hire them on contracts, reducing the number of full time positions. Essentially, this means that in most places your time as a PhD student, postdoc and junior lecturer will keep you outside the employers core staff. Joining those on the inside (with well funded posts) becomes increasingly more difficult. Some have suggested that the world of academia is becoming more like a gang producing drugs \citep{afonso2014academia}.

\hypertarget{doing-a-phd-is-really-hard-work}{%
\subsection{Doing a PhD is really hard work}\label{doing-a-phd-is-really-hard-work}}

It's not a MSc with an extra year. It really is much harder and tougher on you mentally and physically. The chances that you'll end up jaded and malcontent with the entire academic system are very high (maybe even obligatory). You are probably not going to be very happy while doing it (there are some exceptions of course), and it will likely have negative impacts on all the good things that you currently have in your life (think family, friends and relationships, as well as free time and fun).

\hypertarget{your-mental-health-will-likely-suffer}{%
\subsection{Your mental health will likely suffer}\label{your-mental-health-will-likely-suffer}}

Doing a PhD will be the cause of stress not only in your working life, but will also impact other areas of your life. Being aware of this at the outset will allow you to alert close members of your non-working life (think partner, family and friends) that they may well need to act as a support network. It is worth tracking your mental health during your PhD to check that you are not getting into difficulties.

\hypertarget{any-phd-has-to-be-yours}{%
\subsection{Any PhD has to be yours}\label{any-phd-has-to-be-yours}}

It's entirely useless to do a PhD for someone else. You must take complete ownership in order to do it. In fact, you need to be obsessed with the PhD subject and really want to do nothing else at all. A PhD is an obsession where you can be unwavering and manic in your fascination with a subject. Very few people really understand what a great privilege this is. If you don't feel like a total maniac for learning, a PhD is not for you.

\hypertarget{does-it-matter-where-you-do-your-phd}{%
\subsection{Does it matter where you do your PhD?}\label{does-it-matter-where-you-do-your-phd}}

Not all universities in the world have a PhD program. This means that you cannot do a PhD in some institutions. Larger institutions are more likely to hold PhD programs, have more potential advisors, and may even have funds for bursaries to conduct PhD studies. It is likely that you are going to need to do some work at the university in order to justify any bursary that they may want to give you. Typically this kind of work is the teaching of undergraduates which is a generally good and positive experience in the world of academia.

The country where you study a PhD does not determine the quality of institution (see Figure \ref{fig:THEreseasrchcountry}. Rather look at the merit of the particular institution that you are interested in. Surveys like that from the \href{https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2021/world-ranking}{Times Higher Education Supplement} can help give you an overview.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/THEreseasrchcountry} \caption{\textbf{It's not the country that determines the quality of your university.} In this plot you see the Times Higher Education (THE) World Ranking (2021) score for Research plotted by country (with ≥ 10 universities). Note that most universities in most countries have mean THE Research scores in the lowest quartile. Almost all countries that have institutions in the top quartile, have most of the institutions in that country in the bottom quartile. The point here is that you should look at the quality of the institution that you want to attend, rather than assume that all universities from certain countries have high or low research profiles.}\label{fig:THEreseasrchcountry}
\end{figure}

Depending on where you study might mean that you have different amounts of course time. There are some institutions that will carry on funding you for as long as you want to carry on studying. This is unusual. Most countries now have a restriction on the amount of time that you can spend studying a PhD.

It does make a difference where in the world you do your PhD. There are some beautiful places to work. Some places are more expensive to live and therefore survive. If you are a biologist then you might want to consider where your study animals or plants are in order to decide your place to study. But most of all your choice of where to study is likely to be dictated by the presence of an adviser that you want to work with, and who wants you as their PhD student. Advisors are tied to their institutions, and any principal advisor will need to register you at their own institution, meaning that this will be where you spend your desk time. Some advisors might be more flexible than others, but it will be most likely that you will need to move to the institution where your advisor is based.

\hypertarget{what-to-look-for-in-an-advisor}{%
\subsection{What to look for in an advisor}\label{what-to-look-for-in-an-advisor}}

Throughout this book I will call the person who is the academic in charge of your PhD studies your `advisor'. I will not call them your supervisor. The reason for this is because I think it is much better for you to think of this person as giving you advice and not the person who tells you what to do. This comes back to the idea that the PhD is yours. It is not your advisor's PhD. They will not write it. They will not do all the work that's required for it. That will be yours alone.

Just as I've attempted to do in this book, that person will give you advice. It will be up to you whether or not you follow that advice. Many of my students have not followed my advice. For some this has been the right thing to do. For others it has not. No one can know what the best thing to do is in different situations, because they will almost always be unique. You will be the expert on your project. That means that as the person closest to your project, you are the person who is best placed to make a decision. But your advisor can, and should, help you to make those decisions.

Your advisor can help because your advisor has experience of doing research themselves. They hopefully have some experience of advising other students. And they should have some experience of having done research in your chosen study area before, including having published papers in appropriate journals.

The advisor that you're looking for should be offering or doing projects in which you are interested. There may only be a few people in the world that are doing this type of research, and you may end up having to choose between them. Hence, while you're reading about how to pick a good advisor, your shortlist may only be of two or three people in the world. The project and subject area are going to be strong areas driving your choices moving forwards.

One of the best ways of picking a good advisor is by talking to current or past students. You should ask them how happy they are with their advisor and whether they are receiving the support that they need to do their projects. A good adviser should have an open door so that you can talk to them whenever you need to. Thus, once you have talked to the students in their group, you should also make an appointment to talk to them about your project. It might not be one meeting, there may be several. The more contact you have with them, the more likely you are to be sure that this is the person whose help that you want when conducting research over the next few years.

Good advisors tend to have good strong research groups that work well together. You can look through the publications of a research group to see how well they work together. You should see the names of many of the graduate students appearing on publications demonstrating the level of collaborative engagement within the research group.

A good adviser should have a good network. Both during your PhD studies and after them, you will rely primarily on the network of your advisor as a basis to building your own network. For example, you will go to meetings that they go to, you will be introduced to people that they know, and you may have opportunities to collaborate with people within their networks \citep[see][]{adams2012rise}. Doing a PhD with an advisor that has no network and that does not link up with other academics (or worse is disliked by other academics) might mean that your own work is not recognised, or even sidelined. You can easily check on the network of a potential advisor by looking at the collaborators in their publications, or on their website.

Having said this, the best academics also tend to be very busy, and that may mean that they do not make good advisors. The balance is definitely very tricky, and one of the best ways to make sure that you have enough time for all of your students is to limit the number of students you have. Clearly, this works against prospective students.

\hypertarget{what-to-avoid-in-an-advisor}{%
\subsection{What to avoid in an advisor}\label{what-to-avoid-in-an-advisor}}

Remember that relationships occur on a one-to-one basis, and it may be that not every advisor gets on with every student. There are some advisors who have many problems with many students, and these are best avoided no matter how high their profile is \citetext{\citealp[see][]{malaga2004meyer}; \citealp{abbott2004junior}; \citealp[but also see][ for alternative viewpoints]{vences2004meyer}}. There are other advisers who are so busy that they are never able to meet with their students, and pass this task on to somebody else in their group. Again no matter how high profile these people are, if they can't advise their own students they are best avoided.

At the end of the day there is no such thing as the perfect advisor. You will likely have to make a trade-off on the above points with someone who has a project that they are willing to advise you on, and your chosen area of research.

\hypertarget{what-makes-a-good-project}{%
\subsection{What makes a good project?}\label{what-makes-a-good-project}}

After having made lots of statements about how a project should be your own project the following advice might seem a bit strange. Clearly the work that you're going to be doing will need to fit into the group of the adviser that you've chosen.

The most obvious point to make here is that a project should be something that you want to do and that you're prepared to dedicate yourself to for at least 3 years.

Projects that are cross-disciplinary are likely to lead to more opportunities in more disciplines. You may want to make sure that you do not narrow your focus entirely into a single technique or method. If you view your PhD as a training experience, then it is better not to be doing exactly the same techniques that you have mastered previously, for example during your MSc. It is worth bearing in mind that academia has trends and fashions and that becoming an expert in a brand new technique could land you a job and career. It could equally mean that your entire knowledge of a subject area is replaced by a better approach within one or two years.

\hypertarget{funding-your-phd-studies}{%
\subsection{Funding your PhD studies}\label{funding-your-phd-studies}}

Funding may be one of the biggest obstacles that you come across when wanting to do a PhD. It's important that you consider the funding of your PhD in two separate ways:

\hypertarget{the-funding-that-you-need-to-live}{%
\subsubsection{The funding that you need to live}\label{the-funding-that-you-need-to-live}}

This money is typically called a bursary or stipend depending on where you are in the world. It seems to me that many countries offer bursaries that are not actually enough to live on (e.g.~buy food, rent a house etc.). If you're offered a PhD bursary, especially if it's in another country, then do check on the living cost at that location and whether or not the bursary that you are being offered will be sufficient money in order for you to survive. Also, be very careful to check how long the bursary is for. For example, at my university a PhD bursary is given only for 3 years. After this three-year funding period, you will be expected to have submitted your PhD for examination. If you need further funding to live while your PhD is being examined, and before you graduate then you will need to get a job. There is no more money!

It's a really good idea to talk to people who have already done a PhD to find out more about the different available bursary opportunities, and how people manage with and without them. There is no one single model, and the more people you talk to the more likely you are to discover one that might suit you. Of course conferring with other people can include reading the accounts of many different people who share their experiences on social media. There are blogs and Twitter accounts dedicated to this stuff. Try and be as open-minded as you can.

\hypertarget{the-cost-associated-with-your-studies.}{%
\subsubsection{The cost associated with your studies.}\label{the-cost-associated-with-your-studies.}}

The money associated with the project that you were doing also needs to come from somewhere. Depending on where in the world you can do these studies they will be different expectations of where this money comes from. This is a very important topic for you and your potential advisor to discuss. During the proposal phase of your PhD you'll be expected to put together a budget to determine the total costs of your studies. In reality you or your advisor should have a ballpark figure of how much this Is going to cost and have some idea about where the money is going to come from.

Again if you are moving to a new location to do a PhD then beware that costs are not the same in different countries. For example, you might be used to paying very little money for accommodation and travelling in the field, essentially meaning that you can do as much fieldwork as you like. But in some countries fieldwork will make up such a substantial proportion of the funding that you may be limited in the amount of field work that you can afford to do.

It is possible that your potential advisor will tell you that they don't have any funding for a project that you may want to do. This is both a curse and an opportunity. There are many opportunities to raise money to fund PhD projects. Raising the funding yourself is one way of making sure it really remains your project. But the availability of this kind of funding does vary from country to country and you may want to embark on the fundraising side of your PhD before you register. Especially if you have a limited amount of time once you have registered in order to complete your PhD studies.
Some projects are much cheaper than others. For example, if your intention is to sequence genomes of every animal or plant that you work with, the finance required will likely be far greater than your bursary. If however your intention is to do a PhD that models distributions of populations of animals and plants, then the entire costs may only run to a computer remote access to a computing cluster and data storage.

Funding, and the availability of funding, may well be the tipping point that makes you decide where you will do your PhD studies, and with whom. If you haven't already got the message (see above) then these are important decisions and you may be better off postponing the start of your PhD in order to raise money, and do the project you want, in the place you want, and with the person you want to advise you.

\hypertarget{useR}{%
\section{Reconciling yourself to doing things you've been avoiding}\label{useR}}

Some 30 odd years ago as an undergraduate I was told that I would have to use computers in one of my 2nd year courses. The thought filled me with dread and I remember putting off going into the computer room for as long as I could. It was a steep learning curve, and I struggled. Each time the cursor got to the end of the screen I hit the carriage return button. And each machine had an odd white device attached called a mouse, and I had no idea what that did. All this seems quite preposterous now, but imagine embarking on a PhD in biological sciences without reconciling yourself to using a PC. This is practically where we are now with R \citep{rcoreteam2021r}, and indeed a wealth of other alternative programming platforms.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.33\linewidth]{figures/Rlogo} \caption{\textbf{The ubiquitous R logo.} R (and the invaluable GUI RStudio) has become the go to platform for many statistics and figures in biological sciences}\label{fig:Rlogo}
\end{figure}

If you are not already aware of the prominence that R now has in conducting statistical analyses in biological sciences, then you've missed out on a great deal. The real point here is not that you can only use R, but that R represents a platform that can be easily reproduced (because it's free unlike many statistical software packages), and by saving and making the code available, you are making your data analyses reproducible. We will see elsewhere the importance of reproducibility in sciences \citep{baker20161500}, and the critical role this has in transparency and therefore best practice.

What is perhaps most remarkable about learning R is the freedom it gives you away from large amounts of commercial software. As a basic programming language it can be used for statistical analysis, drawing figures, conducting geographic information system (GIS) level work, and even as a word processor on which to write your thesis \citep[and indeed this book][]{xie2016bookdown}.

If you already know all of the above, then you won't face any major barriers, and you will fit into the new and more transparent world of science with great ease. If the thought of using R fills you with dread, in the same way that using a computer did some 30 years ago, then you should reconcile yourself now before you go any further. Learning R will be a steep learning curve, but it will be made easier by the large amount of excellent video tutorials and online courses that are available.

\hypertarget{and-learning-lots-of-other-stuff}{%
\subsection{And learning lots of other stuff\ldots{}}\label{and-learning-lots-of-other-stuff}}

The same principle that I've written about above can be extended to all sorts of other aspects of your PhD project. You will have to learn new skills, and some of these will be things that you have previously resisted having to do. Allow yourself to be open to all aspects of learning, and all skills. The act of learning opens new pathways in your brain, and using this `muscle' will facilitate future learning exercises.

\hypertarget{lifescientific}{%
\section{The scientific project and scientific living}\label{lifescientific}}

Throughout the book, I make reference to the `scientific project' as a greater plan to which our studies in biological sciences is simply a part. I consider the scientific project as a path that humanity should continue to travel in order to reach a higher and more just way of living. Our societies have evolved from places where superstition and belief were the basis for societal rules that favoured the privileged classes. Science is a process in which we reach conclusions based on egalitarian reasoning and evidence, something that we can aspire for the larger community around us. Already, most societies are making the majority of their collective evidence based decisions through the guidance of science. Therefore, if we consider our knowledge based societies to be democratic, then all citizens of that society should understand the processes under which the foundation of that knowledge is acquired \citep{sagan2011demon}. Yet globally, public skepticism in science has been rising, and has reached as high as 35\%. To consolidate this growing position of science in society, and the decline in public acceptance, scientists will need to become more open, communicative and seen to be conducting their own profession in a way that reflects these ideals. There is evidence that increasing communication from scientists to the public results in a decrease of skepticism (\href{https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/1898512O/3m-sosi-2020-pandemic-pulse-global-report-pdf.pdf}{see here}).

Imagine a world in which all of the principle decisions are made as a result of advances in science, but vanishingly small numbers of people actually understand how science works. This is not a world that we would want, but as Carl Sagan \citep{sagan2011demon} pointed out, it's one that could all too easily happen. Therefore, to prevent the workings of science falling into the hands of a minority, we have a duty to communicate our science to the majority.

Ultimately, what we want from the scientific project is to draw everyone in. That is not to say that there is no place in the world for other subject areas. One of the greatest misadventures in my own education was the indoctrination that I received that there were two streams in education, one for STEM and one for arts. I hope that you managed to escape this narrow minded and factually incorrect view, because as you will discover there are high levels of creativity demanded within the scientific framework, and those who have more talent in communicating their science will likely be more successful in their careers as a result. Moving forward with the scientific project does not mean that everyone must become a scientist, but instead that the process by which scientists establish knowledge is understood. Indeed, as we shall see (below) sceptical thinking, as exemplified in science, is indeed a healthy way for everyone in society to avoid time wasting and potentially being deceived or conned. It is also vital that the scientific process be transparent in a way that results can be understood and therefore respected.

Here I provide an example of the way in which there is a need for efficient communication between biological sciences and civic society:

\hypertarget{example-invasive-species}{%
\subsection{Example: Invasive species}\label{example-invasive-species}}

Alien species are those that have been moved by human agents across biogeographic barriers into parts of the world where they did not evolve. Once these aliens arrive in their new environment, some breed and become established, and after a lag a fraction of these spread and become invasive, often with substantial impacts on the environment and the socio-economic efforts of people in those invaded areas. Invasive species disproportionately affect poorer people in our society, often completely disassociated with the pathways responsible for the introduction and spread. Removing invasive species requires a considerable amount of effort, and unless this is supplied by tax-payers, via governmental policy, falls on those directly impacted. Invasion science, the expanded transdisciplinary area stemming from invasion biology, is required to engage with all stakeholders in invasions, and most importantly to prevent new invasions. Because introductions are made by humans there is a critical need to communicate with those stakeholders along introduction pathways.

For existing invasions, social scientists and economists are needed to determine their impacts on people in invaded areas and determine how to best alleviate the invasion or mitigate its effects without it moving further and impacting more communities. Biological scientists need to assess the impact on the environment, and investigate ways in which the species can be removed, their spread curtailed, or their impacts neutralised. Importantly, the results need to be discussed with all stakeholders to achieve a desirable outcome for those impacted most. Invasions at larger scales will normally require governmental resources to ensure that communities can continue to function, especially to best deliver their services to the society. Governments require evidence based decisions that are reached from well researched studies conducted in the field. Effective measures may necessitate large sums of money, and governments require that this process be transparent so that the taxpayers' money they are investing is spent efficiently.

We know enough about invasive species to be aware that there are greater threats to society from species that have not yet arrived than those already present. This means that all societies need to guard against the threat of potential future invasions, and still maintain the trade that brings needed goods into their areas. Most societies have no checks in place, but the immediate need to prevent new invasions, and halt the effects of existing ones, is recognised on a global scale. Biologists have an important role to play as key agents in informing society on the impacts (especially when they disproportionately impact those least privileged in society), pathways, removal and prevention of invasive species. Failure to effectively communicate with any of the stakeholders along the invasion pathway will result in more propagules arriving, and with them the increased chance of more species becoming established and eventually invasive.

In the case of biological invasions, communication needs first to flow from the various stakeholders to direct the research needed. The solutions required are context specific, and the lessons learned need to be communicated back to the stakeholders, including governmental policy makers, in the form they require to action the findings. Ineffective communication from scientists to the stakeholders may result in solutions being ignored or misinterpreted. Documentation disseminated to the global scientific community, through scientific publications, is needed in case it may help the response of other societies with similar problems.

\hypertarget{should-society-lead-the-sciences-or-sciences-lead-society}{%
\subsection{Should society lead the sciences or sciences lead society?}\label{should-society-lead-the-sciences-or-sciences-lead-society}}

Of course, the answer is simply that there must be feedback between science and society. As science advances, society learns of these advances and views are advanced. To become incorporated as a societal norm takes time. Over time, views from science that appear radical to society become mainstream and accepted. Think of the views on the earth being round, or more recently the general acceptance that the universe started with the `big bang'. The counterculture, also known as post truth, faction in society that espouses views accepted by the mainstream and proved by science beyond reasonable doubt is not a novel phenomenon. Indeed, in the scientific project, we need to accept that these views will persist, but empower the general populace to understand why and how they can be shown to be false. Hence, your view that the earth is not flat is bolstered if you can provide three ways to demonstrate this as fact (pick the ones you like from 7 listed \href{http://crosstalk.cell.com/blog/seven-ways-to-prove-earth-is-round}{here} or \href{https://www.unlv.edu/news/release/round-earth-clues-how-science-proves-our-home-globe}{here}). Otherwise, your assertion that it is not flat will appear as easily denied as a `flat-earther's' assertion that it is. The power of the scientific argument in society is that it is not simply contradiction or gainsay, but that there is evidence.

The scientific project is currently not the open virtuous eutopia that we would like. Indeed, as scientists are humans and part of the current society, they are prone to the same trappings of wielding power and influence in order to get ahead. As you get toward the end of this book, you will see me calling out increasing parts of the scientific project that are currently riddled with bias, thereby weakening the entire process and disenfranchising the most vulnerable. Reforming science is no easy task. Reforms are needed throughout the structures that fund, employ and disseminate scientific research. Sweeping this all away will take a concerted effort, but might well be easier in science than in other sectors of society. Nearly all scientists recognise that science needs to be objective and impartial in order to succeed. Their objectivity makes them an ideal group to kickstart a fairer, more transparent and open system. As you will see, there has already been a move to make science more open, and by embracing this transparency the next generation of scientists will reap the benefits, and be on a sounder footing to improve a better scientific society.

\subsection{Carl Sagan's ``Baloney detection kit''}\label{carl-sagans-baloney-detection-kit}}

or \textbf{``How to know when what you smell is bullshit''}

In his book, Demon-Haunted World, Carl Sagan \citeyearpar{sagan2011demon} provides his take on how science provides scientists with what he terms `Baloney Detection', commonly referred to today as `bullshit'. These are well worth recording here as they provide a guiding light for all scientists whether they be novices, emerging or established. They are also easily taught, and the foundation of what we should spread in the Scientific Project.

As humans, we are all susceptible to bullshit, hoaxes, charlatans and contrived deceptions as they are often more appealing than the truth. However, science is about truth seeking, and by applying a set of simple rules, Sagan argues, we can avoid being misled or distracted by ideas that may waste our time and energy by using `skeptical thinking'. These rules are useful in your scientific life when considering hypotheses or when building arguments to explain your results. However, as Sagan argues, these simple rules are also useful in your day to day life, and as a simplified example of the scientific method, we can pass them onto all our fellow citizens.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  You should always seek independent confirmation of results.
\item
  Seek out different opinions on the results and consider all possibilities
\item
  Don't believe facts simply because they are spoken by an authority on the subject. We know that humans are prone to \href{type1error.html}{confirmation bias}, and often exhibit motivated reasoning, especially if they have some vested interest. Even the most experienced have made mistakes in the past and will again in the future. My preferred way of thinking of this rule is to acknowledge that experts are made of ex- (a has been) and -spurt (a drip under pressure).
\item
  \href{howhypothesis.html}{Use a hypothetical deductive framework}. Instead of accepting the first (hypothesis) explanation, think of all the possible reasons why a result might have occurred and then consider how you could (or perhaps you already have in your experiment) disproved each one. You may find that an untested hypothesis to explain the results represents a major caveat that could be tested, or can't yet be tested. Either way, you need to remain open to the possibility that this explains your results. This leads neatly onto:
\item
  Don't get too involved with keeping your chosen hypothesis \href{type1error.html}{opening you to potential cofirmation bias}. Remain critical to the possibility that it might be wrong, and provide ideas on how to substantiate or disprove competing hypotheses. If you don't, others will.
\item
  If at all possible use a quantitative method to test your hypothesis. You should already be well on the way to this one inside your PhD, but it is worth bearing in mind especially when it comes to considering testing other competing hypotheses. How could they be quantitatively tested?
\item
  Arguments (\href{Argument.html}{as we see later}) consist of a chain of statements that follow one from the other. This chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and the strength of each link in the chain (your argumentative statements) must be critically considered by you.
\item
  \href{Argument.html}{Occam's Razor} dictates that given two hypotheses that equally explain the results, the simpler one is likely more plausible. Or put another way, the more links you have in your chain, the more likely that one of them is not as strong as you would like it to be.
\item
  Your \href{howhypothesis.html}{hypothesis} (or argument) must always be falsifiable. That is, that your test should be able to find that it is incorrect. If your test cannot show that your hypothesis is incorrect, then it isn't worth much.
\end{enumerate}

Sagan provides plenty of real world examples of each of these arguments, and I'd suggest that you consult his book \citep{sagan2011demon} if you are interested in following these up. Similar approaches, but written in different styles, are provided by Richard Dawkins in his \citeyearpar{dawkins2004devil} book: A Devil's Chaplain, and Julia Galef in her \citeyearpar{galef2021scout} book: The Scout Mindset.

I would encourage you not to stop your objective and evidence based thinking when you leave the office. By applying the rules of science to other sectors of society, you will find that there are many societal norms that could benefit from similar reform. Certainly, a lot of the technology developed in science can be used to help society reform, but scientific thinking will help everyone. As well as bringing the world to scientific thinking, we can take scientific thinking to the world.

\hypertarget{citizen-science}{%
\subsection{Citizen science}\label{citizen-science}}

For a long time I struggled with the term `Citizen science' as I reasoned that many such ventures did not involve citizens doing science. To me, most seemed focussed on outsourcing large tasks to willing public participants: i.e.~having citizens do some grunt work. Collecting data, or doing a fraction of the analysis is not science. However, in light of the scientific project, I have changed my mind. All of these projects offer citizens a way to participate in scientific projects in a way that was previously unavailable to them. They promote direct communication between scientists and citizens. In this way, they serve to promote the understanding of science to the general public.

One aspect of this will be to bring more of the population into conducting scientific studies. This can be at the level of funding scientific studies. Crowdsourced scientific studies promote communication between the scientists and the funders to a level that is meaningful to both groups, such that they make up a large scale collaborative research interaction \citep{uhlmann2019scientific}. Citizen science contributions mean that the collection of data can be shared on a much broader scale, than would be traditionally possible. Of particular interest in the biological sciences is the identification and collection of locality data for biological species (on platforms such as iNaturalist). But increasing numbers of projects are demonstrating novel ways for the public to increasingly participate meaningfully in scientific endeavour \citep{bonney2014next, silvertown2009new}. Science is a joyful and spiritual experience for most of us that participate in it. There's no reason not to spread that joy as widely as possible.

\hypertarget{healthy}{%
\section{A healthy body to go with your PhD mind}\label{healthy}}

While I'm busy handing out advice, here's some of the best that I have to offer. If you don't do it already, then when you start your PhD start regular exercise. There's an old adage that `a healthy body leads to a healthy mind'. I never gave it much attention until I started exercising regularly some 7 years ago. Getting fit was the best thing I ever did to improve my work.

\hypertarget{being-physically-active-improves-concentration}{%
\subsection{Being physically active improves concentration}\label{being-physically-active-improves-concentration}}

The first thing I found was that I could sit and concentrate on work for longer. Before I got fit, I was constantly distracted and needed to take lots of breaks. Now I find that my concentration is much better and that as my fitness stamina increases, so too does my ability to concentrate.

\hypertarget{time-to-think}{%
\subsection{Time to think}\label{time-to-think}}

I used to think that the time I spent exercising was unproductive with respect to work. Now I have begun to realise that this represents some of my best thinking time. I use the time I spend trail running to turn ideas over in my head and especially to think through the logic in arguments, and potential flaws in experimental design. This isn't to say that I don't need to put time in at the computer writing it all down, or talking through ideas with colleagues. But I find the meditative time I spend exercising to be especially productive.

\hypertarget{balancing-work-with-life}{%
\subsection{Balancing work with life}\label{balancing-work-with-life}}

Having already told you that doing a PhD might unbalance you mentally, regular exercise is a really good way to make sure that you retain that balance with life \citep[see][]{hotaling2018publishing}. By life, I'm referring to everything away from your academic work. This might include, family, friends, sport, hobbies (even fishing). If you don't have friends outside your academic life, then it would be a good idea to find some so that you can keep in contact with the `real world'.

If you already exercise, then you likely know how important this is. But if you don't then my best advice (above anything else that you might read in this book) is to start as soon as you can. Do whatever is right for you. If you don't already know, then try out different clubs or activities at your institution. There are normally lots to choose from. Make sure that you schedule regular time for your activity, even if that means that you run in the mornings before field work starts, or you spend your evenings doing tai-chi on the beach after a day at sea doing research on dolphins. Take your exercise with you wherever you go for your studies. Take it as seriously as you do your studies and you'll find that both will benefit.

Once you have a healthy body, you'll find that there are all sorts of things that go along with this. The desire to fill it with healthy food resulted, and this later tied in with my interest in the gut microbiome. I now have many fermented foods in my kitchen (much to the horror of my kids), and the improvement of my digestive system. I could go on, but I'll spare you. Instead, I just want to emphasise that I consider that not only will your quality of life improve, but so will your work if you include regular exercise as part of your PhD regimen.

\hypertarget{part2}{%
\chapter{How to get started with writing}\label{part2}}

\textbf{Before you start writing}

The writing part of the PhD is often the most difficult for many students. I think that there are several reasons for this. Writing well comes with practice, and most PhD students have had little experience with academic writing - even if they have already completed a MSc. The same could be said of most early career scientists (even after their PhDs), because writing takes practice and we shouldn't expect that it'll come automatically or immediately. In order to get this practice you need to get started, and (again) many students find starting to write challenging. Here is where this guide will help.

However, before you start writing, it's a good idea to understand some of the ways in which academic writing differs from other writing styles. Good planning is the key here, along with knowing exactly what it is that you'll be writing about. That sounds facile, but at the foundation of each scientific study lies the hypothesis, which is central to being able to build the rest of the chapter.

In this part of the book, I start with an explanation of the hypothesis. As you will see in \href{hypothesis.html}{Part III}, the hypothesis is central to all of the writing in each chapter or paper, and you need to have a very good idea of how to formulate your research question into a hypothesis before you begin. Then I build on helping you think through lots of different aspects of writing in science: style, citations, writing concisely, scientific names, and lots more. Finally, I introduce you to the idea of using a formula to structure your writing.

Before you start writing in earnest, it'd be good to read this part of the book and make sure that you are familiar with the ideas therein. Later, you may need to refer back to sections once you've started writing.

\hypertarget{hypothesis}{%
\section{How to write a hypothesis}\label{hypothesis}}

When you read about the formula of writing a chapter (see end of part 2) you will see that everything in your chapter or paper revolves around the hypothesis or questions that you ask, normally at the end of your introduction. In this chapter, we will take a look at how to write a hypothesis. This is a sticking point for many students. We are used to using and writing questions and statements in day to day communications, as well as reading popular media. But hypotheses (the plural of hypothesis) only rarely float across our desks. So how do we write one, and how do we know if our hypothesis is good?

In addition to this chapter, there is some good information out there on the web, and it's worth looking at this too: (e.g.~\href{https://www.wikihow.com/Write-a-Hypothesis}{Wikihow}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis}{Wikipedia}, etc.). There's also some less good stuff out there, so read critically.

\caption{\textbf{Generating a good hypothesis for your PhD chapter isn't easy.} A good hypothesis will be invaluable in helping you write the chapter. It is important to start working with hypotheses}\label{fig:Hypothesis}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{whathypothesis}{%
\subsection{What is a hypothesis?}\label{whathypothesis}}

A hypothesis is a statement of your research intent. It tells the reader (because just like all of your other written work, it is intended for an audience who will read it), what you plan to do in your research. But there's a little more to it than this. The hypothesis becomes a part of the scientific method if it is testable and (importantly) falsifiable, as well as being informed from previous published work on the subject.

Yes, your hypothesis must be informed by the literature, which is why you spent so much time and effort crafting your introduction to inform your reader of the same. This is also why your hypothesis usually comes at the end of your introduction, because you spend all of the introduction telling your reader about it. There's not much point in writing more after the hypothesis, because once your reader has read that, they are ready to learn about how you went about testing it (in the Materials \& Methods). The other important point to make is that the literature should dictate how you write your hypothesis, and the variables that you include. If, for example, you know that temperature is the most important variable, but all of the literature suggests that it is oxygen, you can't ignore oxygen and you should also frame your hypothesis using this variable (you can have more than one hypothesis after all!). In this case, you will also need to provide a sufficient introduction to temperature as a variable to justify its inclusion in your hypothesis. Perversely, your aim is not to prove that your idea is right, but to show that the hypothesis can be refuted.

We try to write a hypothesis that is falsifiable: i.e.~you can prove (usually using statistical tests) that it is not correct (or at least show that the likelihood that it is correct is very low). That's why it is conventional to provide the `null hypothesis' that is the falsified version of the statement, suggesting that there is no relationship between the variables you have proposed to measure. The convention is to label this `null hypothesis' H0, while the `alternative hypothesis' (the one that says your variables are related as you suggested) is written as H1. When you formulate your hypothesis, it is traditional to write your alternative hypothesis to indicate the directionality of your tested variables. This way the reader can simply imply that the null hypothesis is when there is a relationship, but this will need to be stated if the null hypothesis is more complex.

Karl Popper \citeyearpar{popper2005logic} was the philosopher who proposed that without being able to refute or falsify a scientific problem, it ceases to be scientific. This is the reason for our null hypothesis. If the null is not available as a possible outcome, then logically, there is no science.

\begin{quote}
Karl Popper \citeyearpar{popper2005logic}:\\
\textbf{``\ldots it must be possible for an empirical scientific system to be refuted by experience''. }
\end{quote}

Most importantly, your hypothesis must come first, before you do the experiment or study. Hence the reason why this chapter comes at the start of part 2. Setting the hypothesis after the work is already done is fraudulent, and goes against the scientific method. Obviously, it isn't fair to pose the hypothesis once you already know the answer. This is why there is so much emphasis put on formulating your hypothesis during your research proposal. Getting it right will determine what you do and how you test it. If you think of an extra hypothesis that would be really useful to test once you've already done your study, you can conduct a post hoc test, but this should have more stringent levels of statistical assessment.

Writing a hypothesis isn't easy, but it is essential and once you've understood what to do most of the rest of what you are writing for should make sense.

\hypertarget{what-a-hypothesis-isnt}{%
\subsection{What a hypothesis isn't}\label{what-a-hypothesis-isnt}}

It is not a question and so should never have a question mark after it.

It isn't really a simple prediction: if this then that. You will see on the internet that hypotheses are explained in this simple predictive framework. I say that a hypothesis is not a simple prediction because it lacks the mechanistic and scholarly aspect of a good hypothesis, which is what we want to achieve.

\hypertarget{a-formulaic-way-to-start-writing-your-hypothesis}{%
\subsection{A formulaic way to start writing your hypothesis:}\label{a-formulaic-way-to-start-writing-your-hypothesis}}

\textbf{``If. then. because.''}

Later in the book, I will emphasise that you must have introduced all the variables that you plan to use to test your hypothesis in your introduction. This usually comes in the second paragraph of your introduction, where you emphasise the utility of the dependent variable/s (what you are planning to measure) and your independent variable (what you will manipulate). Both of these variables should then feature in your hypothesis. Next, by paragraph four you will have identified the problem that you are interested in tackling. In addition, your introduction will provide all of the pertinent literature that has relevance to this hypothesis, giving the all important context.

A simple way to consider making your hypothesis is to adopt an \textbf{``If. then. because.''} construction where you add in your problem statement using your independent variable after `if', and your prediction using your dependent variable after `then', and finally the expected mechanism after `because'. Using our example above with the ``If. then. because.'' construction, we would say: ``If environmental temperatures in which tadpoles develop are increased then tadpole development rate is faster because they follow the classic metabolism of ectotherms''. Both independent variable (temperature) and dependent variable (tadpole development rate) are present in this hypothesis, and the predicted relationship between them is clear. In addition, the causal mechanism is stated. You can watch a video about using the ``If. then. because.'' construction here, or read more here. I say that this is a formulaic way to start writing your hypothesis, because it usually ends up as an inelegant statement, which can be better refined for a reader. A citation for your stated mechanism might also help clarify exactly where the justification for this comes from.

Mechanisms (or causal explanations) fall into three main areas: endogenous, exogenous and evolutionary \citep{allen2017scientific}.

\hypertarget{endogenous-causal-explanations}{%
\subsubsection{Endogenous causal explanations}\label{endogenous-causal-explanations}}

Endogenous causal explanations focus on the mechanisms happening inside an organism, such as physiological processes, hormones, reproductive state, etc.

\hypertarget{exogenous-causal-explanations}{%
\subsubsection{Exogenous causal explanations}\label{exogenous-causal-explanations}}

Exogenous causal explanations concern mechanisms that are outside the body of individuals. Common exogenous mechanisms are climatic factors (temperature, humidity, precipitation, etc.), or may relate to the availability of food, predators or mates.

\hypertarget{evolutionary-causal-explanations}{%
\subsubsection{Evolutionary causal explanations}\label{evolutionary-causal-explanations}}

These mechanisms have evolved through time, and often relate to exogenous mechanisms triggering endogenous processes over multiple generations.

Note then that the above mechanisms are not mutually exclusive in their nature, and it may be useful to combine different approaches within biology to ask hypotheses across all of these levels. Mechanisms in biological sciences are rarely simple or act on multiple organismal levels, so designing a controlled experiment in order to test a specific mechanism thoroughly can be very demanding. In other words, can you be sure that the cause is really responsible for the effect that you are measuring?

A good hypothesis will often take an existing hypothesis further, to try to better refine the knowledge on a subject. Hence, it is perfectly acceptable to state that you are building on existing hypotheses (and giving the appropriate statement) when making your own.

\hypertarget{teleological-versus-causal-hypotheses}{%
\subsection{Teleological versus Causal Hypotheses}\label{teleological-versus-causal-hypotheses}}

A teleological argument refers to the reason or a purpose of a particular process. For example, you may measure vertical migration of water fleas and suggest that diurnal migrations are made because the water fleas want to avoid predation. This is a teleological hypothesis because you are suggesting that the reason behind a process is the desire by water fleas to avoid predators. Although a reduction of predation may be a consequence of vertical migration in water fleas, each water flea does not think about predation and then starts it's upward movement as a result. A common mistake made in biology is to apply teleological arguments to processes that have no purpose or region. Evolution is often mistakenly suggested to have a purpose (e.g.~to evolve to a more advanced state), but in fact evolution is not a goal-orientated process. There is no end-point to evolution, and evolution did not start in order to meet some predetermined form or function. On the other hand, a causal hypothesis focuses on the factors about A that cause B.

You should have realised that biologists are principally interested in causal hypotheses, because most mechanisms that are studied in biological sciences have no predetermined goal. If you are a behavioural ecologist, then you will need to be particularly aware of these two types of hypotheses, and when teleological explanations may be appropriate: many types of behaviour are goal orientated.

\hypertarget{how-to-evaluate-your-hypothesis}{%
\subsection{How to evaluate your hypothesis}\label{how-to-evaluate-your-hypothesis}}

Once you've written your hypothesis, how do you decide whether or not it is good? To do this, you might think that you need plenty of experience (and yes, that does help). But really, you just need to look for the elements that are discussed above. So once you've written your hypothesis, try to objectively answer the questions below (for more see \href{https://youtu.be/9KoSGQlIFkM}{here}):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Is there a clear prediction (if. then. statement)?
\item
  Does the prediction use independent and dependent variables correctly?
\item
  Is the mechanism supported by the literature?
\item
  Is the hypothesis testable/falsifiable?
\item
  Does the hypothesis use concise wording and precise terminology?
\end{itemize}

If your hypothesis meets all of the criteria above, then you've done a good job!

Probably one of the hardest issues that you will face in biological sciences is to determine whether your dependent variable is reliant only on your independent variable of choice. For example, a lot of variance in biological sciences will relate to the climate (especially with global change studies), but if your independent variable is temperature, this means that you will need to keep all other climatic variables the same. That is, if temperature is your independent variable, it is the only variable that can change in your experiment. This type of experiment is challenging as temperature often affects other variables (especially that they may vary in an unpredictable way). As soon as you have more than one independent variables, you can no longer test your dependent variable because you don't know which independent variable it is reacting to. Isolating variables is notoriously difficult, especially when we move from the laboratory to the field. You will need to think very carefully about what variables other than those of interest are potentially impacted by your experimental design. If you cannot control for them, this will likely mean that you need to change your hypothesis, or change your experimental design. If you are unsure, then I would encourage you to look carefully at the experiments that others have conducted in the literature.

\hypertarget{TypeI}{%
\section{Being aware that you can get it wrong}\label{TypeI}}

\textbf{Type I and Type II errors }

With all the will in the world, when you are testing your hypothesis using statistics there is a chance that you will accept your alternative hypothesis when it is not valid. This is known as a `false positive' or a Type I error (see Figure \ref{fig:TypeITypeII}). It is also possible that you will accept your null hypothesis when you should have accepted your alternative hypothesis, also known as a Type II error, or a `false negative'. While it won't be any fun to get a Type II error, as scientists we should be more worried about Type I errors and the way in which they occur. This is because following a positive outcome, there is more chance that the work will be published, and that others may then pursue the same line of investigation mistakenly believing that their outcome is likely to be positive. Indeed, there are then lots of ways in which researchers may inadvertently or deliberately influence their outcomes towards Type I errors. This can even become a cultural bias that then permeates the literature.

Humans have a bias towards getting positive results \citep{trivers2011folly}. If you've put a lot of effort towards an experiment, then when you are interpreting your result you might feel motivated towards your reasoning making you more likely to accept your initial hypothesis. This is called \href{https://youtu.be/w4RLfVxTGH4}{`motivated reasoning'}, and is a rational explanation why so many scientists get caught up in Type I errors. This is also known as a confirmation bias. Another manifestation of this is publication bias which also tends to be biased towards positive results, with as many as 84\% of studies supporting their initial hypothesis \citep{fanelli2010positive}. Put together this means that scientists being human are more vulnerable to making Type I errors than Type II errors when evaluating their hypotheses. Although there are deliberate or inadvertent ways of making of Type I errors, here it is important to understand that simply by chance you can make a Type I error: accepting your alternative hypothesis even when it is not correct. To minimise this possibility to a reasonable level, most biologists set α (alpha) to 0.05 as an acceptable risk that they will encounter a false positive (Type I error).



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/TypeITypeII} \caption{\textbf{Type I and Type II errors.} In this figure, the columns refer to the truth regarding a hypothesis, even though the truth is unknown to the researcher. The rows are what the researcher finds when testing their hypothesis. The blue squares is what we are hoping to achieve when we set and test our hypothesis. The grey squares may happen if the hypothesis we set is indeed false. The other two possibilities are the false positive Type I error (red), and the false negative Type II error (black). In the table it seems that the chances of getting one of the four outcomes is equal, but in fact this is far from reality. There are several factors that can change the size of each potential outcome to testing a hypothesis.}\label{fig:TypeITypeII}
\end{figure}

In the following figures (Figures \ref{fig:HighlyUnlikely}, \ref{fig:Unlikely} and \ref{fig:Likely}), you see the outcome of 1000 hypotheses. You could think of these as outcomes of 1000 attempts at testing similar hypotheses in a global scientific effort by individual scientists. The power of the analysis is set at 40\%, and α is set at 0.05. It is important to realise that α applies to all the tests that are made (whether or not the hypothesis is actually correct). This means that when α is set at 0.05, 5\% of the time scientists will find that their hypothesis is correct whether or not this is actually true is, as we shall see, an interaction of several variables.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/HighlyUnlikely} \caption{\textbf{The likelihood that highly unlikely hypotheses you test are accepted.} This figure has been redrawn after figure 1 in Forstmeier et al \citeyearpar{forstmeier2017detecting}. This is a graphical representation of an argument first made by Ioannidis \citeyearpar{ioannidis2005why}.}\label{fig:HighlyUnlikely}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{changing-the-likelihood-of-a-hypothesis}{%
\subsection{Changing the likelihood of a hypothesis}\label{changing-the-likelihood-of-a-hypothesis}}

The difference between Figure \ref{fig:HighlyUnlikely} and Figures \ref{fig:Unlikely} and \ref{fig:Likely} is the likelihood that the hypotheses are correct changes. In the first one (Figure \ref{fig:HighlyUnlikely}) we see highly unlikely hypotheses that will only be correct one in a hundred times. The blue squares denote the proportion of times in which the hypotheses are tested and found to be true. The black squares denote false negative findings, i.e a Type II error. The red squares denote false positive findings, i.e.~a Type I error. Because the hypothesis is highly unlikely to be correct the majority of squares are light grey denoting that it was correctly found to be untrue. Because α is set at 0.05, we can expect that 5\% of the 990 incorrect hypotheses will give us a false positive (49 or 50 times). Although it might seem unlikely that anyone would test such highly unlikely hypotheses, there are increasing numbers of governments around the world that create incentives for researchers to investigate what they term blue skies research, which might be better termed high risk research or investigations into highly unlikely hypotheses. The real problem with such hypotheses is that you are more likely to get a Type I error than actually find that your hypothesis is truly correct.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/Unlikely} \caption{\textbf{The likelihood that unlikely hypotheses you test are accepted.} In this figure we see a scenario of unlikely hypotheses that are found to be correct approximately one in 10 times. Now we see that the possibility of committing a Type I error is roughly equivalent to a Type II error and to the probability of finding that the hypothesis is truly correct. Thus, if your result comes out positive, you are unlikely to know why.}\label{fig:Unlikely}
\end{figure}



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/Likely} \caption{\textbf{The likelihood that likely hypotheses you test are accepted.} In this figure we see a scenario of likely hypotheses that are found to be correct approximately every other time.}\label{fig:Likely}
\end{figure}

Now imagine some groundbreaking research (probably published in a high impact factor journal) that finds a highly unlikely (but presumably desirable) hypothesis is correct (our first scenario of 1 in 100). Researchers from other labs try to repeat the experiment, and some of them also find that they get positive results and get these published. None of the negative results get published, or the investigators don't bother to submit them and move onto other areas of science. The positive results are written into text books and future generations of scientists test these types of hypotheses expecting them to be correct (our last scenario of 1 in 2). When the negative result is produced, a reasonable assumption is that a Type II error has been found, and that these scientists need to increase the power of their tests, inevitably increasing the cost of the experiment. But there are plenty of other ways that researchers could end up finding that their negative result is in fact positive, especially if this is what they are expecting. Simmons et al \citeyearpar{simmons2011false} refer to this as the `researcher degrees of freedom' in which researchers inadvertently or deliberately end up getting positive results because of the way in which they treat either their hypothesis or analyse their data. It is easy to see how a false scientific culture can be erected in these mistaken beliefs, and it is important to be aware of this possibility.

\hypertarget{increasing-the-statistical-power}{%
\subsection{Increasing the statistical power}\label{increasing-the-statistical-power}}

In all of these figures the power of the analysis is set at 40\%. The statistical power of any analysis depends on the sample size (or number of replicates) you're able to use. Some research has suggested that in most ecological and evolutionary studies this is actually more like 20\% \citep[see references in][]{forstmeier2017detecting}. What is important to notice in the next figure \ref{fig:20PowerHyp} is that when we change the power of the analysis (in this case from 40\% to 20\%) we influence the proportion of Type II errors over finding that the hypothesis is correct. While the overall numbers of Type I errors does not change, if your analysis tells you to accept your alternative hypothesis, there is now a 1 in 5 chance (20\%) that it will be a false positive (Type I error).



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/20PowerHyp} \caption{\textbf{The likelihood that likely hypotheses you test are accepted when you increase the power.} Here we see the scenario in which the hypotheses are quite likely to be correct one in two times. Now we can see that the possibility of creating a Type II error is highest. Next the blue squares show us the chances that we find the hypothesis is truly correct. Lastly, there's only 11\% chance of a Type I error.}\label{fig:20PowerHyp}
\end{figure}

What you should see when you look at these figures is that there is quite a high chance that we don't in fact correctly assign a true positive hypothesis. There's actually much more chance that we will commit a Type II error. Worse the more unlikely a hypothesis is, we are increasingly likely to commit the dreaded Type I error.

From the outset we should try to make sure that the hypotheses you are testing in your PhD are very likely to find positive results. In reality, this means that they are then iterations of hypotheses that are built on previous work. When you choose highly unlikely hypotheses, you need to be aware that this dramatically increases your chances of making a Type I error. The best way to overcome this is to look for multiple lines of evidence in your research. Once you have the most likely hypothesis that you can produce, you need to crank up your sampling so that you increase the power of your analysis, avoiding Type II errors.

In biological sciences we have more options than many scientific disciplines to investigate potentially false culture beliefs by using different model species, and looking at problems through different mechanisms. Presenting complimentary results from multiple lines of evidence within your thesis is an extremely powerful way to build evidence for your hypothesis. However, this requires creativity of experimental design as well as an open mind. It may mean that you have to draw upon the most fundamental of scientific abilities: to be comfortable with being wrong. It may also require dogged determination in terms of publishing negative results against the currently prevailing culture. As we shall see (in parts 4 and 5), publishing has another set of challenges.

If your appetite is piqued by this subject, be sure to read the references cited, and read around this subject.

\hypertarget{nohypothesis}{%
\section{What happens if you don't have a hypothesis?}\label{nohypothesis}}

So far we have concentrated on thesis chapters or manuscripts that have hypotheses to test. I have emphasised that there is a need to focus all of the sections of your writing to helping frame and understand the hypothesis (in the Introduction), explain your approach in collecting and testing the variables (in the Materials and Methods), provide the results of your tests (in the Results), and respond to the hypothesis (in the Discussion) together with placing it in context. But what, I hear you cry, if you don't have a hypothesis to test?

There are lots of reasons why manuscripts don't have hypotheses, and the chances are that in a PhD thesis (for example) you will have at least one chapter where there isn't a hypothesis tested. So, given all the emphasis above, what can be done?

\hypertarget{central-problematic}{%
\subsection{Central problematic}\label{central-problematic}}

If you have a particular problem that your research is trying to solve, this may result in a new methodology or perspective rather than testing a hypothesis. This work is still suitable for a journal manuscript (and there are specific journals dedicated to new methodologies). Instead of introducing your hypothesis, you can simply introduce the problem that your methodology applies to. A new methodology will probably best fill an existing gap, and so your introduction will likely point out what this gap is, provide evidence for why existing methodologies don't fill the gap, and outline the variables in your novel approach.

Similarly, if you have a question but not a hypothesis, that your research tries to answer, you can take exactly the same approach to introduce your question.

Hence, no matter what your central problem is, you still need to identify this and put it at the heart of your manuscript so that all of your sections address this point. Of course, there may be more than one, and if so you will need to clearly articulate each one and explain how they are related to each other. If you are unsure about how to move forward, the best thing to do is to look to the literature for other examples of what you're trying to do. Someone has very likely done something similar before. Don't forget to chat about it with your advisor, as they may have ideas about where to look.

\hypertarget{does-it-matter-that-you-dont-have-a-hypothesis}{%
\subsection{Does it matter that you don't have a hypothesis?}\label{does-it-matter-that-you-dont-have-a-hypothesis}}

Having a hypothesis makes your work stronger than if you only have a question or prediction. In each case, while your results might help answer your question or confirm your prediction, they won't test the mechanism (so that you can't explain why you have the results that you do), and they may not be falsifiable/refutable. Of course, Popper would argue that if you don't have a null hypothesis, then your methodology isn't scientific.

To me, it is important for you to know exactly what your study is before you start writing about it, or even before you do the experiments. It is essential for you to frame the context of your study. The central reason why you are writing the study will lie at the heart of the manuscript. In the formulaic approach, it will be verbalised at the end of the introduction. All parts of the methodology will explain how you approached this central aim. So if you can't pin down what this is, then make sure you discuss it with your advisor.

\hypertarget{avoid-harking}{%
\subsection{Avoid HARKing}\label{avoid-harking}}

Hypothesising After Results Known (HARKing) is the practice of creating your hypothesis once the results are in and you've done some preliminary data analyses to see what is significant \citep{forstmeier2017detecting}. HARKing has become prevalent in science because of the confirmation bias by journals (only accepting papers that can statistically accept the alternative hypothesis), especially those with higher impact factor.

\hypertarget{bigidea}{%
\section{What's the big idea?}\label{bigidea}}

In the previous chapters, I've talked about the importance of having a hypothesis, and building that hypothesis in a logical framework within the introduction (see part 3). The introduction serves to inform the reader about why this particular hypothesis was chosen, introducing both the response and determinate variables, as well as the presumed mechanism by which the hypothesis can be falsified (or upheld).

\hypertarget{the-funnel-introduction}{%
\subsection{The funnel introduction}\label{the-funnel-introduction}}

But so much of what you read doesn't have any clear hypothesis, and there doesn't seem to be any thought about building on bigger concepts or ideas. In this chapter, I suggest that this might not be true only of papers on herpetological invasions (my specialist area), but also of herpetology in general (although I concede that some areas, such as herpetological physiology are actually quite good). Further, I contend that using these wider hypotheses or theories would actually be good for the authors concerned, as it would likely garner them a wider audience. Moreover, a greater number of biologists might come to realise how valuable reptiles and amphibians are as models in biology.



\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/Introduction} \hfill{}

\caption{\textbf{A framework for writing your introduction starts with the big idea and ends with the hypothesis.} The funnel introduction is so called because it resembles a funnel in which you channel the reader from their own interest in a wider subject area into the relevance of your particular study.}\label{fig:Introfunnel}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{so-where-would-we-find-all-of-these-big-ideas}{%
\subsection{So where would we find all of these big ideas?}\label{so-where-would-we-find-all-of-these-big-ideas}}

There are quite a few papers that synthesise hypotheses in various areas of biology. Here I provide two to get you started. Ask your advisor about relevant reviews of hypotheses in your area of biological sciences. The first is by Mark Velland \citeyearpar{vellend2010conceptual} on theories in community ecology. The next is by Jane Catford and colleagues \citeyearpar{catford2009reducing} on hypotheses in invasion biology, but I encourage you to look for more up to date versions. Each of these papers will give you a list of big ideas, together with the citations for seminal papers that have built them. You will note that many of these theories are very old with some dating back to Darwin. You can think of the way that such ideas are structured as a hierarchy of hypotheses (Figure \ref{fig:JeschkeHagar61}).



\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/JeschkeHagar61} \hfill{}

\caption{\textbf{A hierarchy of hypothses can be used to help determine your Big Idea.} A useful structure for thinking about how hypotheses are structured was presented by \citet{heger2018hierarchy} in what they termed the \emph{Hierarchy of Hypotheses}}\label{fig:JeschkeHagar61}
\end{figure}

Of course, there are many ways to approach and test these theories, but if you don't know about them, your work may actually make a considerable contribution to upholding or refuting them, but go totally unrecognised. When the significance of your work isn't realised, it's unlikely that it'll be widely read and cited.

Let's face it, if all the effort of the work that we put into papers is just going to get buried, then is it really worth it? The work that we do is also expensive, so making it as relevant as we can to as wide an audience as possible is something that we should be concerned about.

So, I encourage you to \textbf{stand on the shoulders of giants} (Figures \ref{fig:Googlescholar} by using big ideas in your introduction. Make sure that the data that you collect can actually be used to respond to some of these big ideas. Then make sure that you cite them, giving them the importance that they deserve (yes, even as key words) so that others can find your work, and you might even find that one day, your work has shoulders that are broad enough for others to stand on!

\textbf{The take home message}

Reading the literature can really expand your mind and broaden your horizons. When undertaking a literature review {[}or when reviewing a paper{]}, take the time to think about not only what has been tested, but what could have been. Make a list of theories and hypotheses in your own field and try to rank them in a hierarchy.

\hypertarget{paragraph}{%
\section{Writing a paragraph}\label{paragraph}}

In the following chapters, I will explain how to write a scientific paper in a formulaic style, as well as the advantages that this has over starting from scratch each time. The suggestion is that once, you sketch out your paper in a `bullet-point' outline. This outline will give you an idea of the subject in each paragraph, as well as how the paragraphs fit in with each other. The other suggestion was to flesh out this outline by assigning relevant citations to help you remember those main ideas.

Writing paragraphs has a skill all of its own, and the aim of this chapter is to go over the basics of how to put a paragraph together. Other people have also written about this, and you can read an example here.

\textbf{This paragraph starts with a topic sentence which contains the principle idea that citations are needed for examples.} The following sentences put this idea into the context of your study. This should be based on examples from existing literature with the corresponding in-text citations provided (Smith et al 2017; Jones 2018). You can use examples in your paragraph to make your point. For examples, Smith and Jones (2017) carried out a study that showed that examples without citations have no credibility for readers. And this was backed up by another study by Jones and Smith (2018), which provided further evidence for the need to provide examples. Once you've provided your evidence, and introduced any covariates that you need to, like the use of literature for examples, then you are ready to sum up and link. \emph{After reading this paragraph, the reader will know why citations are needed for examples, and they'll be ready to read more about the topic of writing a paragraph in more detail.}

In the paragraph above, the topic sentence is bold, the supporting sentences are normal font, and the clincher is in italics.

\hypertarget{topic-sentence}{%
\subsection{Topic sentence}\label{topic-sentence}}

A topic sentence allows the reader to understand quickly the idea/topic you are putting forward in the paragraph. It must be in the context in which you are going to develop the same topic. There's no point in just mentioning a topic in passing or using it in a different way than you will later.

Make your topic sentence relatively simple. Don't be tempted to add multiple clauses. If the topic sentence is too complex, you'll lose your reader right at the beginning of the paragraph.

\hypertarget{supporting-sentences}{%
\subsection{Supporting sentences}\label{supporting-sentences}}

Supporting sentences convey all the relevant information to the reader. They are going to be statements that are well cited, showing readers where the original ideas came from. Be sure to keep these sentences on topic, and regularly refer back to your outline to make sure that you keep to the original objective of the paragraph. These are the meat of the paragraph and it's really important to get them right.

If you are writing about differences, then state which way the difference is. For example, if bullfrogs are larger than leaf litter frogs, then say this. Telling your audience that something is different than something else only ends up leaving them guessing about the way in which the things are different. There's no point in drip dripping this information through. Set it down in as little space as possible so that your reader doesn't get bored.

Sentences within the meat of the paragraph interact, and there's a great example to show how this is done here. These interactions usually dwell around pertinent variables (such as those that you are going to deal with in your paper). By using the same or similar words within the paragraph, you are able to demonstrate to the reader how those different points interact.

While repeating the names of the variables, or their abbreviations, can be helpful, repeating descriptive words becomes quite tedious to the reader. Repeatedly reading the same ideas repeated over and over quickly bores the reader. Bored readers are less likely to take in what you write, even if you are repeating the same information (yes, I'm repeating myself - boring isn't it). It will also give the reader the impression that your vocabulary is very limited. These days you can do a quick right click on a highlighted word to get a drop down list of synonyms (Figure \ref{fig:synonym}). This can allow you to go back and replace your repeated word with: recurrent, frequent, recurring, repetitive, constant or continual. That's more than enough to spice up the paragraph. However, if you're not sure whether a word is correctly replacing another, ask a friend to read it.



\begin{figure}

\caption{\textbf{How to quickly get a synonym to make your paragraph more diverse.} An example of the synonym function in Microsoft Word (other wordprocessors are available) - right click on the highlighted word.}\label{fig:synonym}
\end{figure}

Your supporting sentences are best built in the formula of an \href{argument.html}{argument}.

\hypertarget{the-magic-of-threes}{%
\subsection{The magic of threes}\label{the-magic-of-threes}}

We can learn a lot about writing convincingly in science by borrowing from storytelling, and one of the greatest lessons in storytelling involves the magic of threes \citep{angler2020telling}.

In putting together your paragraph you can use the magic of threes to break your dialogue into three parts: thesis, antithesis and synthesis (a, b and a+b). Think of it this way: there's a standard explanation of how a phenomenon that you want to investigate interacts with the variable of your choice (thesis). Then there's some contradictory evidence that suggests that the standard explanation is not necessarily correct (antithesis). Lastly, there is your approach to investigate exactly how the variable and phenomenon interact which should explain (or at least advance our understanding) of how the variable and the phenomenon are related (synthesis). It may be that this construct should be fleshed out into three paragraphs instead of three sentences within a paragraph.

You won't be able to construct every paragraph with the magic of threes, but once you have learned this rule, you'll be able to use it to help emphasise important points in your manuscript that you want the reader to remember as they move forwards. What if your list is two instead of three? Well then you'll lose the magic, but maybe you can think it through it again? If you have two, then you normally have three by means of the combination of the two (a, b and a+b).

What follows is more advice about telling a good story: using an example and avoiding being boring: i.e.~replacing those long lists with a maximum of three items.

\hypertarget{use-an-example}{%
\subsection{Use an example}\label{use-an-example}}

Examples are a very powerful way of conveying ideas in a short amount of space. Don't replace your paragraph with an example, but do use an example if it shows the reader just what you want. You should be able to do this in a sentence (or two), but if you're tempted to go on, it's probably not a good example. Because the first paragraph sets out ideas, it's unlikely that an example there will be a good idea.

\hypertarget{avoid-lists}{%
\subsection{Avoid lists}\label{avoid-lists}}

I'm not a big fan of paragraphs which are simply a long list with little or no thought offered. The worst ones are where there are so many citations along the way that it's really hard to pick out what is a sentence and what is citation. I understand that it's important to show precedent and that there is merit in showing how widespread an idea is over taxa or in different disciplines. You never find these lists in journals where words and/or citations are limited, which suggests that you can dispense with them.

Instead, you can avoid long lists by pulling them into themes. Once you've managed to get three themes, you'll find that you can work them into your paper time and again. For example, each theme might well be worth a separate paragraph or section in the discussion.

\hypertarget{the-last-sentence-of-the-paragraph-the-clincher}{%
\subsection{The last sentence of the paragraph: the clincher}\label{the-last-sentence-of-the-paragraph-the-clincher}}

Once you've conveyed all of the information that you planned to impart in your outline, it's time for the last sentence. This should conclude the evidence that you've provided on your topic. Try not to make it lame. For example: ``This shows that little work has been done.'' One of my pet hates is authors who insist on telling us that ``little work has been done'', as if this was a justification for doing anything. Instead, make it a real clincher about why the topic is important, or how and why you will tackle it. Instead (or as well if you can), you may want this sentence to link on to another paragraph (topic), especially if flow is important at that part of your outline (see below). If you have just constructed a paragraph with thesis, antithesis and synthesis, then your clincher might be simply to underline that your approach in the paper is to investigate the synthesis. Either way, make sure that your last sentence is on topic, and one that sticks in the readers' minds.

\hypertarget{above-all---read-it}{%
\subsection{Above all - read it!}\label{above-all---read-it}}

Your paragraph is not finished until you've read it. Reading is an essential part to writing that cannot be emphasised enough. Does your paragraph say what you planned in your outline? If your paragraph and any other text doesn't make sense to you, it sure won't impress anyone else. If you can't bear to read it through immediately, then do it after you've written two or three paragraphs. I suggest that you don't wait until you've finished the manuscript. Rather get the text right as you go along.

\hypertarget{how-does-the-paragraph-fit-into-the-flow}{%
\subsection{How does the paragraph fit into the flow?}\label{how-does-the-paragraph-fit-into-the-flow}}

So now we've gone over the formula, it's time to take a step back and look again at the paragraph in the context of your outline. Remember that the paragraph represents a single subject, but that it is still just part of the manuscript as a whole and you need that to flow from beginning to end. This means that it's not enough to write each paragraph in isolation, but to think of the way in which they link together as a whole, especially when you are trying to make a logical argument.

You might get a comment from me about missing logic in the argument or a lack of flow in a paragraph. This usually comes from not having a good outline (see below). You should be using the outline to provide the logic in the flow of your argument, flesh it out with the relevant references. If you already know this well, then writing the paragraph will just be a question of styling the outline. Remember that there is a purpose to your paragraph. You have an argument to make the reader understand. Don't be tempted to include information that is distracting or moving away from the flow of that argument.

I am very fond of ending a paragraph on a linking sentence. Essentially, this shows how two ideas are connected in the last sentence. This really helps with getting the flow of an introduction or discussion, but linking sentences are not always the best way to end a paragraph. Sometimes there's no option but to change the subject completely, and then you should go for the clincher idea (see above). For example, you may want to end the paragraph by seeding a new twist on the paragraph's idea.

\hypertarget{seeding-ideas}{%
\subsection{Seeding ideas}\label{seeding-ideas}}

The introduction sets out the established literature in order to put your study in context, but your discussion provides you with an opportunity to present new ideas, or to turn and twist existing ideas in a new way. Once you've got a good idea what these are, I like to seed the introduction with hints as to what these might be. Sowing seeds early in a manuscript will provide the reader with hints as to where you are going. Writing these seeds as questions is a really good way of sowing them into an introduction. You can then go on to answer them (if only partly) in the discussion. Beware though, there's no point in asking a major question in the introduction to which your data has no relevance!

\hypertarget{breaking-the-rules}{%
\subsection{Breaking the rules}\label{breaking-the-rules}}

Just as in the other instructions on formulaic paper writing, when writing a paragraph you shouldn't feel totally constrained so that you can't break the rules. Breaking the rules can set you free, and much of what you read that really stands out will do this. However, it's much easier to break the rules and get it wrong, than break them and get it right. The idea of this chapter was to help you get started, not to communicate with those who are already writing great stuff. So if you're already great, don't break it by doing any of this!

\hypertarget{some-common-paragraph-mistakes}{%
\subsection{Some common paragraph mistakes}\label{some-common-paragraph-mistakes}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Don't start your paragraph by linking back to the previous point. Start with your new topic sentence. If you aren't ready to change the topic, you aren't ready for a new paragraph.
\item
  Don't start the paragraph with an unsubstantiated or over-inflated claim (keep it calm and within the bounds of what you are citing). Similarly, don't start with a trivial caveat. And don't start with a list or long string of citations.
\item
  Don't let your paragraph get too long. It is said that 250 words is the threshold. If you haven't covered what you wanted to in your outline within 250 words, then you need to rethink your outline for that paragraph! Definitely don't split a paragraph that's too long into two!
\item
  If you started without an outline, it's never too late to go back and write an outline. Simply write down what you are trying to say (as a set of bullet points), and why (see below for an example).
\item
  Your paragraph should have more than one citation in it. If you find yourself citing the same paper several times in the same paragraph, then there's something wrong with your outline, and the way that you are reading and citing papers (see below). Remember that what you write is about making your own argument from the literature, and not copying others arguments.
\end{itemize}

The English grammar rules apply when writing science. I can't go into these in detail here as they are legion and complex. However, here are a few mistakes that are often made by those writing in science:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  You should not start a sentence with an abbreviated genus. Instead write the genus name in full.
\item
  You should not start a sentence with a numeral. If you have to use the number as the first word, write it out. Otherwise, rearrange your sentence.
\item
  Make sure that acronyms are spelt out on first use (this may be needed for each section)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{argument}{%
\section{Construct a logical argument in your writing}\label{argument}}

Writing is not straightforward. Your objective is to communicate with a reader, someone who you've likely never met and will never meet. You need to communicate highly complex information. But more than that you need them to see things as you do. You need to provide them with your reasoning and your argument, and have it make sense to them; preferably to the point where they agree with you.

To communicate, you need to start from common ground. The beginning of your introduction starts with the most general concepts in the context in which you are writing. The context depends on your audience, and this in turn relates to the particular journal that you are writing for. Even if you are writing a thesis, you should pick out a target journal for each of the chapters. Once you've established the common ground, you need to carry the reader towards the hypothesis or question that you propose. The easiest way to do this is to make use of a logical argument:

A series of statements that introduce a starting premise, provide evidence for and against that premise (perhaps adding in an example that makes your point), point out what missing information would allow reaching a better understanding of said premise, and logically conclude that what you are doing is going to fill this gap.

This logical argument style is most prominent in the early introduction of your manuscript, although the entire introduction could be seen as one long logical argument, with a few smaller more precise arguments being thrown in along the way. You might also use a logical argument in your discussion to explain how you deduce certain inferences from your results, or provide a logical extension for a future study.

The following science argumentation model (Table \ref{tab:argument}) is modified from Cope et al \citeyearpar{cope2013science}. Try using this model to guide your writing of a paragraph of your introduction (or discussion) where you attempt a logical argument.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}

Remember to cite the person who came up with the idea. \\

\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

If your logical argument doesn't arrive immediately, don't force it. Give it some thinking time to let it settle in. I find that logical arguments develop best when I'm not sitting at my desk writing. They come when I'm reading other papers (especially those with well written arguments), taking a deep, hot bath, or when I'm out running in the mountains. If you are more social, talk through your logical argument with others, perhaps over a cup of coffee. It really helps to keep the ideas turning in your head. Don't cut yourself off from work thoughts when you are away from work.

There are other shorter forms that might suit you better. Consider another classic form of the scientific argument: ``compare and contrast'' which allows you as a writer to quickly familiarise your reader with some key examples. Another sentence structure to consider is explaining cause and effect. For practical wording examplesof both of these classic arguments, \href{phrasebank.html}{see part 2}.

\hypertarget{arguments-in-latin}{%
\subsection{Arguments in Latin}\label{arguments-in-latin}}

From time to time you may come across comments about arguments that you've made in your work made in Latin. Why do people use Latin and not simply say it in English? What do these phrases actually mean? While you may think that these people are being pompous or trying to demonstrate some scholarly superiority by quoting Latin at you (and you might be right), there is some important reasoning to consider both in the meanings of these argumentum (as they are known in Latin), and the fact that they are as old as Roman scholars, and often much older. This then is the point, that some arguments are faulty, and that this has been known for thousands of years.

Here I have provided some of these arguments, and the reasons why they may appear in your thesis in writing biological sciences.

\emph{Ad hominem} - ``To the man'' means that the argument attacks the person and not the argument.

\emph{Non sequitur} - ``It does not follow'': suggests that one statement in your argument is not linked to the next. This is also known as a logical fallacy, a formal fallacy or a deductive fallacy (for a full list of fallacy statements and their explanations, see here).

\emph{Post hoc, ergo propter hoc} - ``it happened after, so it was caused by'': mistaking cause and effect simply because one thing happened after another. The two events may have been completely unrelated.

\emph{Reductio ad absurdum} - ``reduction to absurdity'': attempts to establish a claim by comparing it to an absurd opposite.

\emph{Novacula Occami} - ``Occam's razor'': The idea that the simplest hypothesis, or argument is most likely to be correct. Another way to think of this is if you have two models that you test are equally likely (e.g.~within 2 dAICs), the one with the least number of variables should be considered superior. This is also known as the priciple or law of parsimony: \emph{lex parsimoniae}.

Likewise, there are some arguments in English that you will hear time and again. I take the opportunity to also list these here:

\textbf{Correlation does not equal causation} - That two events or variables are related when in fact they are co-incidental.

\textbf{Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence} - The idea that positive evidence of the existence of a relationship is superior to a lack of the same evidence. This is also known as a Type II error (false negative), where the lack of finding a significant relationship does not lead to a conclusion that the relationship does not exist. Later we discuss how a \href{transparency.html}{lack of finding of a significant result} leads to confirmation bias in science.

\textbf{Observational selection} -``The root of all superstition is that men observe when a thing hits, but not when it misses.'' Francis Bacon \citeyearpar{bacon1620novum}. This refers to the cherry picking of studies that support your hypothesis while omitting those that do not support it. Later we see how this can be abused when writing a review or even the introduction to your chapter.

\textbf{Straw man} - Erecting a false or simplified statement in order to make it easier to attack.

\textbf{False dichotomy} - Considering that two extremes of a continuum are the only possible alternatives.

We have seen elsewhere how science is built on the works of those that have worked before us. When we construct a logical argument in science, we do so using this scholarly accumulation of knowledge as presented in the literature: citations. That is to say that your claims must be backed up by the literature. To do this, you will need to read that literature and make sure that it can back up your claims. Beware of making a baseless claim.

It may be that when researching your question, you come across the same argument using the same literature rehashed time and again in different papers (it happens). Does this give you a green light to do it again? I'd like to think that you already know that there are likely lots of other untapped and better examples out there, and it'd be well worth your while constructing your argument yourself.

Beware of copying an argument wholesale. You might well end up getting muddled, or worse perpetuating an error. Better go back and make sure that you understand the original premise and the works that promote or oppose this. Having told you to beware, I'm now going to encourage you to read, because \href{criticalreading.html}{reading is one of the best ways in which you can learn about writing a logical argument}.

Reading critically will make you aware of when you come across an argument. Ask yourself:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Did you understand it?
\item
  Was it written in a conventional style (as in the table \label{tab:argument})

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If not, how was the style broken with and did this improve or detract from the understanding?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In this writing book, I concentrate on providing formulaic approaches to writing, because these are by far the easiest ways for inexperienced writers. However, I encourage you to learn and experiment with writing styles as you become more experienced. \href{criticalreading.html}{Critical reading} is one of the best ways to learn about alternative writing styles (see here): reading is probably the best way of improving your writing. Alternatively, and especially if the above hasn't clicked with you, you can read more about writing a scientific argument (see for example \href{https://msu.edu/course/iah/231b/gifford/sciaargs.htm}{here}). And there's plenty more out there.

\hypertarget{storytelling}{%
\section{Storytelling in science?}\label{storytelling}}

I started thinking about this topic some years back as I often need to write popular articles that make some of the science that we do more generally accessible. But then I came across an article by Nick Enfield \citeyearpar{enfield2018our} that made me think again.

``No storytelling'' is a comment that I sometimes make when reading drafts of manuscripts, chapters, and even when editing for journals. What do I mean by this? Stories are deterministic. That is to say that the storyteller has an end in mind when they start telling the story, and the telling is a way to get to their goal. A story that's `pointless' will frustrate the audience and won't engender them to listen to that storyteller again. In a good story, reaching that goal will often result in lots of twists and turns with the goal shrouded in mystery until it is revealed. In a teaching story (like a parable), the goal may be overt, such that the audience relates to the narrative and buys into the same conclusion.

If we did science like we tell stories, we would decide on the way the system works before we studied it, and then design the experiment in order to reach our desired goal. You should have recognised by now that this is not the way we do science. This is clearly an undesirable way to go about doing science because we should never prejudice the result that we'll get from a study before we do it. Hence, writing stories and writing science are different processes.



\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{the-danger-of-a-teleological-argument}{%
\subsection{The danger of a teleological argument}\label{the-danger-of-a-teleological-argument}}

Teleological arguments are those which have their end point as the aim. While it is generally acknowledged that this is a good way to tell a story, it can be a trap when it comes to conducting scientific inquiry. Here, we need to approach science in a very different way to storytelling. When I was doing my PhD I was very frustrated as I had the impression that my advisor knew what result he wanted and designed the study to show it. What probably happened is that he was displaying ``motivated reasoning'', but the result is known as ``confirmation bias''. When an experiment failed to meet the expected result, he declared that it had failed. As Frances Bacon so elegantly put it:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{``Once a man's understanding has settled on something (either because it is an accepted belief or because it pleases him), it draws everything else also to support and agree with it. And if it encounters a larger number of more powerful countervailing examples, it either fails to notice them, or disregards them, or makes fine distinctions to dismiss and reject them, and all this with much dangerous prejudice, to preserve the authority of its first conceptions.''}
Francis Bacon \citeyearpar{bacon1620novum}
\end{quote}

In our work, we read other studies and observations to formulate a question that we frame as a hypothesis. We then devise an experiment that will test this hypothesis in the most objective way, so that we can fairly accept or reject our null hypothesis.

\hypertarget{science-is-the-very-opposite-of-storytelling.-or-is-it}{%
\subsection{SCience is the very opposite of storytelling. Or is it?}\label{science-is-the-very-opposite-of-storytelling.-or-is-it}}

I often tend to think of the answer to the question as the goal of the study. That I don't know what the answer is, doesn't spoil the story for me. The important thing is asking the question. An unexpected answer might send us back to thinking more about the system that we are studying and result in a greater revelation.

A good example of this is the study published by Becker et al \citeyearpar{becker2018extreme}. Francois found a (spookily) strong relationship between probability that Rose's dwarf toadlets survive and local rainfall in the breeding season. More rainfall equals greater survival is what one would automatically think (because frogs like rain), but that wasn't the result obtained. Francois found that survival increased with less rainfall. It wasn't until we made the connection between the fact that increased rainfall during the breeding season meant that the toadlets spent more time in puddles, that we understood why their survival was decreasing. As the toadlets aren't feeding during this time they lose weight, and also expose themselves to increased predation pressure. In a dry year, the toadlets will head back to their subterranean refuges much earlier and continue to pursue `safer' feeding and hiding habits. While we might intuitively feel that a `safe toadlet' is a better life-strategy, reduced rainfall means reduced reproduction, and so results in a failure for toads that don't manage to pass on their genes that year. The result is a variable life-history with the weather, something that was previously unknown. To me, that's a great story!

But the scientific paper that was written about this `story' \citep{becker2018extreme} doesn't have a narrative style, and doesn't fit the description of a narrative that we discussed above. Instead, it follows the formula that we set out below: Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results and Discussion. This style does not treat the experiment as a complication on the way to the story's goal. The structure introduces the rationale behind conducting the experiment, then objectively explains the findings, and lastly discusses their meaning in relation to what is already known. From this study, I can spin the story (above), because I know what the endpoint is. But this storyis just one interpretation of the correlation that was found. \href{argument.html}{Correlation is not causation}, and more studies would be needed to test the hypothesis concerning the underlying reasons suggested for the relationship observed. The key differences in the storytelling style from the scientific formula are the absence of a known goal at the start of the process (see a more detailed discussion of this by Yarden Katz, \citeyearpar{katz2013storytelling} here).

There is a role for stories when communicating science as this increases interest, facilitates understanding, and enhances memory. This is particularly true when communicating science to the public and making it more accessible, but it also applies to interactions between scientists, for example at conferences. The \protect\hyperlink{proposal-presentation.html}{presentations} that tell a story and entertain are those we tend to remember. Not easy, but if we do want to communicate well with each other, then we need to learn the art of storytelling, without compromising our scientific objectivity. In addition, there are lots of lessons from storytelling that we can use within scientific papers, and to which I subscribe wholeheartedly. For example, don't be boring, don't \href{style.html}{bamboozle}, write an active narrative (not in the passive tense), use the magic of threes, and many more.

I've taken the deterministic interpretation of storytelling (a story with a known ending), and I've used this to argue why it is not a good tool for science. But it is a great tool for communication. And storytelling can be used to improve the way that we write science, and especially the way in which we communicate science.

There are other fundamentals in stories that are particularly useful and should not be ignored. One notable feature of stories is that they make facts easier to understand and remember. Indeed, there is even the idea that this is why storytelling evolved in human societies. For example, most religions are based on stories that are geared to understanding of societal morals and rules. Martin Angler's \citeyearpar{angler2020telling} excellent book about how to turn science into stories should be consulted to give you some deeper insight into why stories are more powerful than science. Or try the exercise described by Torres and Pruim \citeyearpar{torres2019scientific}.

\hypertarget{can-storytelling-help-memory-of-science}{%
\subsection{Can storytelling help memory of science?}\label{can-storytelling-help-memory-of-science}}

Some argue that it can, and should be an integral part of scientific writing. In her \href{https://www.annaclemens.com/blog/elements-of-a-story}{blog post}, Anna Clemens argues that stories should be used within the scientific context. I'll let you read this for yourselves, and ask you to make up your own minds. If you like this way of thinking, you can get deeper into the depths of story thinking with Angler \citeyearpar{angler2020telling}.

\hypertarget{citations}{%
\section{Why do you need to cite?}\label{citations}}

Citations are a means of recognising that your work is built on the work of others. They are part of the fundamental tenets of science that we don't start from scratch each time we conduct a study.



\begin{figure}

\begin{quote}
Isaac Newton (in a letter to Robert Hooke in 1675) wrote:\\
\textbf{``If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.''}
\end{quote}

Although the phrase is often attributed to Isaac Newton, it turns out that it was well accepted in Newton's time and has been traced back to the 12th century.

Essentially, standing on the shoulders of giants (Figures \ref{fig:Googlescholar} is a recognition that all research is built upon research that has gone before it, and this is the basis for citations in the text of scientific papers. Patrick Dunleavy \citep{dunleavy2017citations} argues that citations are required to meet 7 criteria with respect to academic writing. Others have suggested that there are more criteria \citep[see][]{harwood2009interview}, and that these are a fundamental premise of academic work. But it was not always thus. If we dwell a moment longer, we can look back at the World's longest running scientific journal: \emph{Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.}

You can download the first of those papers of 1665 and note that there are no citations (other than to books or letters) because there were no previously published articles from which to draw. However, even then authors noted that ideas came from previous authors and we can regularly find acknowledgements that refer back to Aristotle (\textasciitilde350 BC).

\subsection{Research is built on existing work and ideas}\label{research-is-built-on-existing-work-and-ideas}}

It would therefore be very unlikely that your idea/ideas has no basis in existing literature. If you can't find it, the chances are that you haven't looked in the right way. Try Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science and vary the search terms or try searching for articles citing something similar.

Citations demonstrate to readers where your ideas have come from. Citations can also be used to reduce what you need to write -- especially with respect to methodology. If you (or others) have already provided the methodology in full then you can give a much simpler description and the citation.

Citations need to be used to back up any statements of fact that you make in your PhD chapter. Any examples need citations for where the examples came from, and when you make \href{argument.html}{arguments}, you add credibility to your arguments from each side by citing that these are from published works.

\hypertarget{your-citations-say-a-lot-about-you}{%
\subsection{Your citations say a lot about you}\label{your-citations-say-a-lot-about-you}}

When you choose to cite one paper over another, you are making a statement about what you find credible in the literature and what you don't. For example, if you choose to cite a poorly conducted study as the cornerstone for one of your arguments, then others may interpret that your arguments are built on shaky foundations. Experienced (often senior) readers who know the literature well will be able to judge the quality of your work not only by what you've written, but on what you've based your ideas through your citations. As we will see later on, there's a lot to think about when deciding what to cite, and what not to cite.

\hypertarget{cite-while-you-write-not-afterwards}{%
\subsection{Cite while you write (not afterwards)}\label{cite-while-you-write-not-afterwards}}

Automatically, I'd suggest that you cite whenever you write. Using citations becomes habit forming, and you'll end up wanting to use citations everywhere. Popular scientific writings tend not to have citations, but they can still be there but subtly different.

Within a manuscript for a scientific journal or in your thesis, you can expect that your \href{introduction.html}{introduction} and \href{discussion.html}{discussion} sections are going to be full of citations. The methodology will likely also be citation rich. By using a lot of citations in your methods, you can often save your needing to write a lot of sections which would otherwise be very detailed.

Later in the book (\href{formula.html}{Writing with a Formula}), I explain how to start writing with an outline, then flesh out the outline with citations from your reading, and plan which citations you are going to use carefully before you start. This won't stop you from adding more later, but this ensures that your work is built on your scholarly endeavour.

I've seen many students try to write their text first and then only later fill in citations. I've had students hand in thesis chapters and manuscripts that have {[}ref{]} written strategically at the end of many sentences. I've even had the experience of doing this myself when I was a early career researcher (I probably still have those manuscripts somewhere because it's a sure way of never getting anything finished). I suggest that you \textbf{do not do this.} The reason is that if you write first and try to insert citations later, you are going to spend lots of time looking for the citation that fits your text. This is clearly not the right way around. Your text should be based on what's present in the literature.

I was planning to write that no-one would ever write an entire manuscript without references, and then put them all in at the end. Then I came across a video by \href{https://youtu.be/yk54_j3-4RM}{Pat Schloss}, and realised that I'm wrong \citep{schloss2018riffomonas}. Pat states early on (in the video) that he prefers to write first and cite later. He's clearly a very experienced researcher and knows his literature very well. Indeed, he knows it all so well that he already knows what citations fit what statements without needing to look them up. However, later on in the video Pat admits that even he sometimes gets it wrong, and that means that he ends up having to rewrite text when he finds the publication that he was thinking of and notes that what they actually found did not fit what he wrote. Although I can identify with what Pat is saying, I would find this re-writing far too time consuming to take this approach myself. I am familiar with most of the pertinent literature in my specialist area, but I'd rather check things before I start writing than leave it until later. I find that my memory is not only wrong about what other people have found, but also about what's in my own work. Therefore, I'd suggest that while you may aspire to write like Pat later on in your career, right now it'd be better for you to plan your writing with citations in mind, and cite while you write (not afterwards).

When you submit a draft of your chapter to your advisor, they may suggest additional citations that are known to them. Don't simply add blindly, but look them up and check their relevance to the statement concerned. They may require recrafting of the statement, or a query back to your advisor.

\hypertarget{citation-styles}{%
\subsection{Citation Styles}\label{citation-styles}}

There are a number of different styles, and this is likely to depend on the journal that you are writing for \citep[see][]{pandey2020methods}. The two most prevalent styles in biological sciences are often referred to as Harvard (name, year) and Vancouver\textsuperscript{1} (superscript numbers that are listed in the reference section). Most universities and journals require Harvard style. The intricacies of how exactly this will get carried out will change from institution to institution and journal to journal. You will have to find out what is relevant to you.

\hypertarget{vancouver-style}{%
\subsubsection{Vancouver Style}\label{vancouver-style}}

Vancouver style dates back to medical journals in the 1970s and refer to conventions to avoid fraud in medical sciences. In biological sciences, they are not used as widely as Harvard style, but are chosen as they don't impede the flow of the text for the reader.

Each style has its pros and cons. Vancouver style is more equitable and anonymous, as all cited people are represented only in the references and do not have their names plastered throughout the text. The diminutive numbers take up less space, allowing the reader and writer to concentrate more on their prose. On the other hand, if you are familiar with the literature, or you are interested in learning more about the literature, you'll find that the little numbers take much more time to cross reference with the list at the end, than does Harvard style. Reference strings in Vancouver style can either be separate numbers, or numbers listed as a series. Because citations are numbered in the order in which they first mentioned, citation strings later in documents often end up as a list of non-sequential numbers separated by commas.

Here is an example of text \citep[from][]{measey2016global} with citations in Vancouver style:

\begin{quote}
Amphibian populations are currently declining across the globe\textsuperscript{1-3} and alien amphibians are at least partially driving these declines through competition\textsuperscript{4}, hybridization\textsuperscript{5} and introduction of novel pathogens\textsuperscript{6-9}.

\hypertarget{harvard-style}{%
\subsubsection{Harvard Style}\label{harvard-style}}

The standard way is to use the name and year in parentheses at the end of the statement to which the citation is relevant. Names of three or more authors are frequently reduced to ``et al.'' (often written in italics) which is short for the Latin et alia, meaning ``and others''. References strings in Harvard style can go on for an entire line of text or more. Some journals have rules that mean on first mention the citation should have all authors (up to a certain number). This can become tedious when citations start taking up more space than text.

A repeat of the above example, except with Harvard style shows how much more space these same citations take up.

\begin{quote}
Amphibian populations are currently declining across the globe (Wake and Vredenburg, 2008; Collins et al., 2009; Pimm et al., 2014) and alien amphibians are at least partially driving these declines through competition (Kupferberg, 1997), hybridization (Dufresnes et al., 2015) and introduction of novel pathogens (Berger et al., 1999; Daszak et al., 2003; La Marca et al., 2005; Martel et al., 2013).

From here on (and throughout the book - because the book uses a form of Harvard style), I concentrate on Harvard style as this provides more freedom for how citations can differ.

\hypertarget{moving-from-harvard-to-vancouver}{%
\subsection{Moving from Harvard to Vancouver}\label{moving-from-harvard-to-vancouver}}

Essentially, every time you would have had the year and date, you will replace this with a superscript denoting the number for that particular citation. However, Vancouver style does not allow for much variation in how you cite. You can't use (e.g.~\textsuperscript{1,2}) or (see \textsuperscript{3} for a review). This means that when you originally wrote for a Harvard style journal, but then change the manuscript to submit it to a journal that uses Vancouver style, you'll need to remove any explanations of citations. That doesn't mean removing the citations themselves, but it may mean re-writing some sentences. Simply changing your reference manager to use the different referencing style will only be the start of your work.

\hypertarget{where-within-a-sentence-should-the-citation-come}{%
\subsection{Where within a sentence should the citation come?}\label{where-within-a-sentence-should-the-citation-come}}

There are a number of different styles, and this is likely to depend on the journal that you are writing for. The standard way is to use the name and year in parentheses at the end of the statement to which the citation is relevant.

The impact of all invasive amphibians is similar to that of invasive birds and mammals \citep{measey2016global}.

You'll see that sometimes the names are brought into the sentence and become the central agents of the text. The phrase et alii (often abbreviated to et al.), literally means ``and others'' referring to the other authors (typically used when there are more than two - but check the journal format!).

Sometimes, instead of ``et al.'' you can write ``and colleagues'' or ``and others''. This is something to do occasionally when you are looking to diversify some text. Don't over do it though.

\begin{quote}
Measey et al. \citeyearpar{measey2016global} found that the impact of invasive amphibians is comparable to that of birds and mammals.
\end{quote}

This technique is very useful when you then want to add another sentence or two about this same study.

\begin{quote}
Measey et al. \citeyearpar{measey2016global} found that the impact of invasive amphibians is comparable to that of birds and mammals. They did this by constructing GISS scores for all individuals in all groups.
\end{quote}

Because the authors are the subjects of the first sentence, the citation becomes implicit in the second sentence. Then you don't need to use the same citation again within the paragraph.

What about page numbers?
Sometimes you'll see a citation with a colon and page number after. This really only needs to be used if you are quoting specific text on a particular page:

\begin{quote}
Measey et al. \citeyearpar[976]{measey2016global} proposed that using GISS scores could show that ``some amphibians can have devastating impacts to the environment''.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{what-about-the-order-of-the-citations-in-a-string}{%
\subsection{What about the order of the citations in a string?}\label{what-about-the-order-of-the-citations-in-a-string}}

A citation string is a list of two or more citations that all assert the statement given. When you provide a string of citations you will need to decide which one comes first. Normally, this is given in the order of precedence: the oldest citation comes first, the youngest last. However, journals have their own styles and these may dictate how citation strings are ordered. For example, they could be alphabetical. If your referencing software has a style then you can relax. Otherwise, you'll need to look it up!

\hypertarget{what-about-citations-as-taxonomic-authorities}{%
\subsection{What about citations as taxonomic authorities?}\label{what-about-citations-as-taxonomic-authorities}}

Taxonomists have special rules for this, and I'll do it in another chapter (see section on \href{taxonomy.html}{Scientific names and taxonomic authorities}). These are not the same as regular citations (because they don't appear in the literature cited and you don't have to have read the descriptions), and only some journals ask for them.

\hypertarget{is-it-possible-to-mis-cite}{%
\subsection{Is it possible to mis-cite?}\label{is-it-possible-to-mis-cite}}

Yes. One of the most common ways in which students mis-cite a paper is to use statements made in the introduction (or discussion) which were not the subject of the study. For example, in the introduction of their paper, Measey et al. \citeyearpar{measey2016global} make comments on amphibian decline.

\begin{quote}
Amphibian populations are currently declining across the globe \citep{wake2008are, collins2009extinction, pimm2014biodiversity} and alien amphibians are at least partially driving these declines through competition \citep{kupferberg1997bullfrog}, hybridization \citep{dufresnes2015introgressive} and introduction of novel pathogens \citep{berger1999chytrid, daszak2003infectious, lamarca2005catastrophic, martel2013batrachochytrium}.
\end{quote}

However, it would be wrong to give a statement on amphibian decline and cite Measey et al. \citeyearpar{measey2016global}. They did not study amphibian decline. Instead, you should read the papers that they cite \citep[e.g.][]{wake2008are, collins2009extinction, pimm2014biodiversity}, and read around those to find studies on amphibian decline that are appropriate for your context. This underlines one important aspect of choosing citations where the statement that you make relates directly to the study carried out in the citation.

Another common mistake is to forget which paper has which information. You can try to make sure that you don't do this by taking better notes or a more accurate plan.

No.~When you are citing a study, you should be sufficiently familiar with the publication that you are endorsing the study in relation with the statement that you make (but see below). If you are not convinced by the nature of the study that you are tempted to cite, then rather don't cite it and use another one. If you can't get hold of the paper, this is another reason why you might not cite it. This is a regular reason given for why Open Access journals attract more citations.

\hypertarget{what-should-i-not-cite}{%
\subsection{What should I not cite?}\label{what-should-i-not-cite}}

This does depend on the journal you are writing for. Some journals don't permit citations to unpublished data or web sites. My suggestion would be to avoid such sources anyway (with particular exceptions -- see below), unless it is really important that you include it. Other examples of texts to avoid are: text books (use the original paper instead), newspapers or magazines, blog posts, facebook pages (or other social media sites), predatory journals (or any non-peer reviewed article). These are all examples of \textbf{grey literature}.

There are of course exceptions. When you are writing about social media sites, or newspaper coverage, you will want to cite those sources.

I don't like citations to guide-books or general text books. This has become very common, but really smacks of laziness. Most of what's written in a guidebook has already been documented in the scientific literature, but guide-books generally don't provide sources for the information that they provide. Thus, it's easy to look up and find something in a guide-book, but suggests (to me) that you haven't spent enough time or effort reviewing the literature. Some guide-books are excellent and the authors have gone to a lot of trouble to incorporate original data and observations. But this is unusual, and most data can be found in publications.

One exception to the not citing websites relevant to our work is the IUCN Red List. Note that all entries on this site now have DOIs, and this might be a good guide for what is available to cite. The Digital Object Identifier (\href{doi.html}{DOI}) is very useful as it means that there is a consistent record of that version. Otherwise, you could cite any website (even this one) and then the owner can go and change the site and it no longer says what you thought it did. The DOI removes this problem; there will always be an archived version with that particular DOI.

You should not cite papers that have been retracted.

\hypertarget{do-i-cite-the-review-or-the-primary-literature}{%
\subsection{Do I cite the review or the primary literature?}\label{do-i-cite-the-review-or-the-primary-literature}}

The primary literature are studies or experiments that are done in order to test a hypothesis. Secondary literature includes reviews, syntheses or meta-analyses. Primacy (see below) is important, but this depends on the space you have and whether the review contains all the information you need to cite. Sometimes reviews (especially meta-analyses) provide more information. It's preferable to use primary literature, but sometimes reviews (or meta-analyses) are actually more expedient to use, especially if they are not the focus of your study. You can even cite both when relevant.

\hypertarget{what-is-primacy-and-why-does-it-matter}{%
\subsection{What is primacy and why does it matter?}\label{what-is-primacy-and-why-does-it-matter}}

Primacy in the literature is the paper/s where the authors provide the original idea or concept that you are citing. It is important in that you should give credit to original ideas over those who copy or simply repeat them, or even those who review them. Sometimes primacy is less important, especially if the concept is well known and has changed substantially. Then you should cite the most recent work that shows the ideas that you are wanting to show. Other times, primacy is important - especially when few have built on ideas or concepts since they were put forward. If in doubt place a citation to the original study and the most recent study, then flag this using a comment for your advisor to consider. The important point here is for you to give credit where it's due and not to overlook those who put in the hard work to publish original content.

\hypertarget{how-many-citations-is-enough}{%
\subsection{How many citations is enough?}\label{how-many-citations-is-enough}}

Some journals have a word limit, or even a limit to the number of references that they allow. Others do not, and you should probably use what is recently published as a guide to what is acceptable. For the chapter of a thesis, you should err on the upper end; from 50 to 100 references. Note that citations may well be more as you may cite a paper more than once.

Obviously, everything you cite needs to be in the References (or \href{references.html}{Literature Cited}) section, and you may well need to spend time deleting extra stuff. You can get around this common issue by using a citation manager like \href{references.html}{Mendeley, Zotero or EndNote}. I'd always suggest that you use one of these tools as they can really help with your reading too. These days they are busy turning into a kind of scientific social network. They regularly make suggestions of what you could be reading based on what you read. This can be useful.

If you are looking for multiple examples of a statement that you've made and there are many possible, I'd suggest that you aim to produce three. Make sure that you use a suffix (like ``e.g.'') to show that you are aware that these are examples of a widely reported phenomenon. You can choose these as you like, but may want to consider using what you consider to be `the best' examples, and/or references that you are planning to use elsewhere in your paper/chapter. This can drive the total number down considerably, and helps to keep the citations more relevant to your work.

\hypertarget{should-i-cite-myself}{%
\subsection{Should I cite myself?}\label{should-i-cite-myself}}

If you are publishing relevant and appropriate papers, then there is no reason not to cite yourself. In many cases (such as with your thesis work), your own publications are likely to be more relevant to methodology and subject matter than much of the other work that is out there. However, if you've previously published on termite fungus and now you're publishing on frog toes, it's unlikely to be relevant. Choosing citations should include your comfort with being transparent. If you know when citing yourself that citing another article would be more correct in showing where an idea came from, but citing your own is more relevant to the application, then you should feel comfortable in citing both.

I would avoid citing your thesis if possible, rather put it all into papers. There are times though when citing your thesis is unavoidable. Within your thesis, I would suggest that you do provide citations to different chapters as this will help the examiners see how the chapters relate to each other.

Take a look at this article on self-citation. They claim that self-citations in the Natural Sciences run at 33\% \citep{vanraan2007scoping}, which provides you with a nice idea of what is acceptable. Remember that this would include not only your citations to your articles, but all citations to your co-authors articles too.

\hypertarget{should-i-cite-my-friends}{%
\subsection{Should I cite my friends?}\label{should-i-cite-my-friends}}

It may be easier to cite your friends if you already know their work well. You may have heard them talk and know that the subject is relevant. They may be encouraging you to cite them, but should you?

In these days of scientometrics, we do need to acknowledge that citations act as a kind of currency. They count towards your H-index \citep{hirsch2005index} and this can reflect on your prospects as a postdoc or employee. What's also clear is that cited papers get cited more, so it could really help your friends if you cite them. Obviously, the inverse is also true, so beware of the politics of citing. However, the most important points have already been raised, but will be tackled \href{impactfactor.html}{in detail later}. The study must be relevant and appropriate before it gets included as a citation in your work.

\hypertarget{does-the-impact-factor-of-the-cited-article-matter}{%
\subsection{Does the impact factor of the cited article matter?}\label{does-the-impact-factor-of-the-cited-article-matter}}

Papers in journals with high impact factors are more likely to be cited because their contents are already thought to be of interest to a wide range of people. Indeed, there is evidence that identical statements published in many journals, those with higher Impact Factors are cited more \citep{perneger2010citation}. That is something that the editors of that journal will have considered even before sending the manuscript to review. Sometimes (but not always) the impact factor of the journal can be an indication of the quality of the study. But you should judge this for yourself when you critically read the paper.

I find that the first paragraph of a paper is more likely to contain citations of higher impact journals. This is in part as these are likely to be more cross cutting (as is often the case for the first paragraph). In the end, if you need to make a choice, choose the paper that is most relevant, irrespective of impact factor.

\hypertarget{databases}{%
\section{Literature databases}\label{databases}}

Databases of scientific literature have been around since the 1960s when the number of journals and papers started increasing so much that scholars simply couldn't keep up. Quite simply, you should use one or more of these databases to look for relevant literature to read. The first database, and what continues to be one of the largest, was the Science Citation Index (now renamed \href{https://www.webofknowledge.com/}{Web of Science}) that sought to record not only the contents of journals (titles, abstracts, authors and other metadata), but also the citations that each paper used. As we have seen in the last chapter, citations record the way in which people find the literature useful, and are therefore a highly effective way of finding related and pertinent literature in your field.

Before you start using a literature database, you will need to have some key literature with which you are familiar and that relates directly to your project. If you don't have this, then check with your advisor. Often, this key literature is cited in the advert for the PhD, the grant application that funded it, or if this is a topic that your advisor has already conducted some research on, then their own publications may include part of the key literature. If you are not familiar with your advisor's (including co-advisor's where appropriate) papers, then a great first step is to search for them on a database and read through titles and abstracts that are relevant to your research topic. Once you have a set of key literature (this might only be 5 to 10 papers), then it is time to go to the literature databases to do your search.

\hypertarget{searching-the-literature-using-a-database}{%
\subsection{Searching the literature using a database}\label{searching-the-literature-using-a-database}}

There are two typical ways in which you can search for literature about your area of interest. The first is to use keywords and the second is to use citations of key references. I suggest that you use both of these tactics when doing your initial literature search. Further, I'd suggest that it's worth your time keeping a record of what you have searched for, how and when and then download the results. This is called a systematic literature review. Using this tactic from the outset of your interactions with literature databases will give you a good idea of what proportion of the literature you are reading, and you might then be able to convert your finding into an objective literature review - making a great first introductory chapter for your thesis.

\hypertarget{keywords}{%
\subsection{Keywords}\label{keywords}}

While searching for keywords sounds easy, picking the keywords that you should use is more difficult and requires a lot of practice with the databases and your key references. Remember that keywords are often not single words, but also include short phrases. Look at all of the key references and the keywords that they contain. Any keywords that they share are going to be important for you. Most literature databases have the option of using keywords or keywords and words in the title and abstract. I would start with the broader search term and see how well they work. However, these searches alone may return such a large amount of literature that you can't possibly read it all. In this case, you will need to use more than a single keyword. The trick is to find the correct combination of keywords that will deliver all (or most) of your key references, while not delivering returns of thousands of papers that are not relevant to your study. Ideally, you want a search term that will deliver around one hundred papers at most, where the majority have relevance to your study area. Luckily, literature databases have some tricks for you to add to combine your keywords in ways that you can include or exclude certain topics.

\hypertarget{boolean-terms-or-operators}{%
\subsubsection{Boolean terms or operators}\label{boolean-terms-or-operators}}

There are three principle Boolean operators: AND, OR and NOT.

You should use these to combine a string of keywords. They are relatively straightforward to use:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Use AND when you want both terms included. For example, \emph{performance AND lizards}. In this example, all papers that mention performance AND lizards in the title, abstract or keywords are returned.
\item
  Use OR when you want to include both terms. For example, \emph{performance AND lizards OR geckos}. This example should return more literature than the previous search as it will include, all papers that mention \emph{performance AND lizards OR geckos} in the title, abstract or keywords are returned. You will note that geckos are lizards, but people who write about geckos might not mention that they are lizards in the title, abstract or keywords, so you may need to use these extra search terms in order to pick up all of the relevant literature on lizards. If your research requires you to cover all lizards, then you might need a lot of search terms in the OR string in order to pick up all of the literature that covers lizard performance.
\item
  Use NOT when you specifically want to exclude a keyword. Following our example above, the search term \emph{performance AND reptiles NOT snakes} should give you all performance papers on lizards, but you may want to exclude turtles and crocodilians as well if they have a lot of hits.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{proximity-operators-and-parentheses}{%
\subsubsection{Proximity operators and parentheses}\label{proximity-operators-and-parentheses}}

You can also use the term NEAR to indicate that two terms need to occur within a specified number of words. For example, performance NEAR/5 reptile will capture items where these occur within 5 words of each other, but no greater. This might be useful to exclude some papers that mention performance and reptiles in the abstract, but are not about reptile performance.
Once you start putting together search strings you will need to use brackets to make sure that the correct terms are grouped. For example, performance AND (lizards OR geckos) will get what we described above, whereas (performance AND lizards) OR geckos will give you all papers on lizards and performance plus all papers on geckos (not what we wanted).

Explore the advanced search options of the specific database that you are using to see the correct semantics needed for a search.

\hypertarget{wildcards}{%
\subsubsection{Wildcards}\label{wildcards}}

Most literature databases allow you to search using different wildcards. These are *, \$ and ?. These can be placed at any point within a search term and help overcome differences in spelling, or families of words that you may want to capture or exclude in your search.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Use * when you want to replace a set of letters at the end of a word. For example, \_reptil*\_ will return all terms including Reptilia, reptile and reptiles.
\item
  Use ? when you want to search for any single letter at that place in a word. For example, \emph{sterili?e} will capture words with sterilize and sterilise.
\item
  Use \$ when there is more than a single letter that might change within a word, or the omission of a letter. For example, \emph{colo\$r} will return both US and UK spelling, color and colour, respectively.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{combining-searches}{%
\subsubsection{Combining searches}\label{combining-searches}}

Lastly, there is the option of combining searches, so that you can add search strings together or keep them apart. You will need to use the advanced search options in your database to do this.

You will need to carefully check your database for their precise semantics when using these Boolean operators in a search string. They are all slightly different, often using quotes around the keywords, and your search won't work as you intend unless you are using the Boolean operators in the way the database dictates.

Your specific search term may end up having a long list of terms. Remember to save this whenever you make a search, especially if you refine it during your studies. Most literature databases will provide the search string that you used together with the results. Check your search string carefully for possible spelling errors that could influence your search.

\hypertarget{citations-1}{%
\subsubsection{Citations}\label{citations-1}}

In addition to using keywords, you should search citations of your key references. Typically, when you start reviewing the literature in your specific area you will have a few key references that have been given to you by your advisor. Having read these, you will already know that they cite other works of interest, and you should follow up to look at all that seem relevant. But that's not all, these key publications are likely to have also been cited themselves by newer papers. Tracking citations of key papers can help you keep abreast of what is happening in your field. Indeed, given the prolific ever increasing nature of scientific publications, it might be the only way to keep on top of what is happening. Some literature databases allow you to receive alerts if a paper is cited, and you should set this up for all of your key citations, and perhaps for some of the most prominent authors in your field.

You can't search every paper for all the references that it cites, and its own citations. Although this would give you a solid systematic basis for your literature search, it is likely to be too much work. Getting good search terms for your keywords, and finding key references to search for citing articles is a better strategy as it makes your literature searches manageable. If you refine and save your search terms it also makes it repeatable. This will provide you with a solid basis for moving forward with your PhD, and with appropriate alerts make sure that you keep up with the latest literature in your field.

The above section is a brief guide, and your library is likely to have in depth guides on how to use the specific databases that they house. They may also provide training sessions, or online videos to watch. It is worth becoming familiar with exactly how the databases that you will use work, so this is time well spent at the beginning of your studies.

What else are literature databases used for?
The Science Citation Index used to be published as a single volume that emerged each year and was available in the reference section of the library. By the time that I started at university as an undergraduate in the 1980s, it was several volumes large and my first task for my tutor (one Dr Dave Thompson) was to look up all of his citations. Within a couple of years, the database was digitised and available on CD, and eventually became accessible through the internet.

Clearly, the Science Citation Index cost some money to put together, and universities paid annually to receive the books, and then the CDs and finally to access the online versions. They were not for profit organisations, but eventually they were bought out by the evil profit making parasites of science. Yes, publishers saw the dependency that scientists have on a resource and decided to own it for themselves and then radically increase the price to access it.

\hypertarget{administrators-want-metrics}{%
\subsection{Administrators want metrics}\label{administrators-want-metrics}}

But it wasn't just scientists that were interested in the databases of literature. Administrators became interested in the metrics that the databases produced on academics so that they could use them as a measure of performance, or potential in the case of hiring academics. The obsession with simplifying metrics by administrators who don't understand the work that their academics produce, has driven the importance and proliferations of literature databases. However, it is widely acknowledged that the way in which journal metrics are used is unhealthy, and this has led to the \href{https://sfdora.org/read/\%5D\%20(known\%20as\%20DORA)}{San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment}.

In the life sciences, there are three prominent databases used: Google Scholar, Web of Science (owned by Clarivate Analytics aka Thomson Reuters) and Scopus (owned by Elsevier). But new players are entering the market all the time, and two of the newest are Dimensions from Digital Science and Microsoft Academic.

\hypertarget{google-scholar-web-of-science-or-scopus}{%
\subsection{Google Scholar, Web of Science or Scopus?}\label{google-scholar-web-of-science-or-scopus}}

Have you ever wondered why Google Scholar (GS) scores are so inflated compared to other citation databases like Web of Science (WoS) or Scopus? I've always noticed that Scopus has better coverage than WoS, and that GS is bigger than both (and a lot messier with lots of weird duplicates and poorly entered stuff), but is there anything more to it than that?

Well it seems that there are some people who have already thought about this, and come up with a good idea of exactly what's different. Martín-Martín et al \citeyearpar{martin-martin2018google} have done a great job of analysing all this stuff from some 2.5 million citations. What they found inspired me to write this chapter, in which I've focussed on the results from the Life-Sciences. But I encourage you to go read the article for yourself.

I have been known to take the odd peak at my Google Scholar profile over the year, and see how it's coming along. I rarely check on WoS or Scopus, 'cos it's a bit of a faff getting signed in and doing the search. Plus it looks so much smaller when one is habituated to seeing those double digits in GS! However, I've always been a bit uneasy about citing my GS citation rate, H-index or i10 (among others that they give) as I've never really known what all that extra represents. Something grey and unseemly? Well, it turns out that it's all good stuff, and perhaps GS is the better one to cite as it's a more inclusive index: more inclusive of different document types and different languages.

It is worth noting that of the three indices, Google Scholar seems to be the easiest to manipulate. Delgado López‐Cózar et al \citeyearpar{delgadolopez-cozar2014google} show how it is possible to manipulate citations and therefore metrics of individual researchers by depositing false documents into institutional repositories (note that they did this as an experiment, and you may find that restrictions on doing this at your own institution are prohibitive or lax). The authors also note that a consistent problem with Google Scholar is the lack of transparency, and therefore verification, of how the bibliometrics are calculated. This will make a difference to what papers are found, as Google Scholar tends to report those with the greatest citations first on the first page of outputs. Hence once a paper is initially boosted by manipulation, it will be more likely to be found and increasingly cited.

To directly compare your citation metrics from different platforms, and also to get more unbiased metrics than these platforms provide, consider using the software Publish or Perish \citep{harzing2007publish}. This also provides a great platform on which to harvest data from Google Scholar into a database, or put it directly into another database, like EndNote, Zotero or Mendelay.

\hypertarget{whats-the-difference-between-indices}{%
\subsection{What's the difference between indices?}\label{whats-the-difference-between-indices}}

Martín-Martín et al \citeyearpar{martin-martin2018google} allows you to interpret your GS results as a more inclusive citation index. While WoS and Scopus aren't exclusively English or journal publications, they are mostly. But that extra third that GS gives you allows you to show the extra scope that your work is getting outside that English journal mainstream. Is your GS score more than a third higher than your WoS or Scopus score? If yes, then your work is having a greater impact elsewhere in the world, and there's nothing wrong with that.

The excerpts from the two tables above show how well GS correlates with both WoS and Scopus in our area (Biological Sciences). It also tells you by how much the GS score is likely to be inflated - 1.90 for GS/WoS and 1.45 for GS/Scopus. Again, if you deviate from this with a higher score, you can give yourself a pat on the back for having work that's reaching more people in more parts of the world.

\hypertarget{software}{%
\section{What software should I use to write my PhD?}\label{software}}

Thirty years ago, when I started to use computers as an undergraduate, the word processing standard was a piece of software called WordPerfect. Back then it seemed inconceivable that anyone would want to use anything else, or that WordPerfect could lose its grip on the market. WordPerfect became a victim of the Microsoft revolution that standardised most PC operating systems (think Windows) and software using Microsoft Office in the mid-1990s. The chances are that today your institution will still have subscriptions to Microsoft Office making it free for you to use. But given that changes in software can happen so fast and appear to change with increasing frequency, should you use Microsoft's Word to write your PhD?

The simple answer is that you should use whatever you, and your advisor, feel most comfortable with. You will face a lot of challenges during your PhD including learning to write with lots of different kinds of software. Each one you learn to use will require a steep learning curve and that requires time. If there's any good time to start with a new word processing package it will be before you start your PhD. If you do decide to go with a new writing package then my suggestion would be to choose open source software like latex or R markdown. More on these later.

If you feel comfortable with a word processing package with a nice GUI, like Microsoft Word, then go ahead and use it. My best suggestion is that you do not save your files in their default \emph{.docx format. Instead make sure that all of your files are saved as }.rtf or html. This should make little difference to your opening and editing but will mean that all of your texts are forward compatible with other kinds of software. It will reduce your file size and reduce the chances of file corruption: i.e.~when part of the file malfunctions and you lose the contents. That's right, in addition to loss of data by back up deficiencies \href{data.html}{see Part III}, you also have the risk of having corrupt files that will also mean you lose all of the contents. Even if you always use Word and never use any other file format, do yourself a favour and save each version as a \emph{.rtf or }.txt file as well. Just like a back up, this means that you won't have lost all of the text if a file goes corrupt. And yes, I do know people who have multiple backup versions of corrupt files: it's happened to me.

The real problem with word processing packages like Microsoft Word is when files get very large as they tend to do during a PhD. Once you start putting chapters together especially if they include embedded images tables and the like you will find that many word processors start misbehaving. This can be especially frustrating in the closing phases of your PhD when you're trying to submit it. Especially if there's a tight deadline. However this problem is easily overcome by chunking your thesis into documents equivalent to chapters and then merging PDFs from each chapter.

\hypertarget{alternatives-to-conventional-word-processors}{%
\subsection{Alternatives to conventional word processors}\label{alternatives-to-conventional-word-processors}}

Many academics are turning to latex in order to write their manuscripts as this gives a lot of possibility to insert links, formulae, references, images, etc in a very simple way. Once you are ready to print a latex document it can be shared very easily as a PDF.

Be aware that the problems may come not with what you want but with how your advisor and or co-authors are comfortable with. I find that commenting on a PDF takes more time than doing the same on a word document. I don't mind working with latex but I know some advisors are very adverse to having to use this platform. Obviously in order to get the feedback from your advisor you are going to need to use a platform that they are also comfortable with. So please consult them on what they are happy to use. You may also need to instruct them about how to make comments. For example track changes is a function that a lot of people like to use but it doesn't translate back into other platforms seamlessly.

As with many things in this book I urge you to keep an open mind with respect to software. For example if your lab is progressive and already experimenting with new and flexible software platforms then I suggest that you learn with them. The future of computing is certainly likely to be open-source software and so the sooner that you become more familiar with this the easier you will find it to adapt in future.

Another consideration is how your word processing package is going to work with referencing and citations. Again your lab may already use some software that you want to integrate with your word processor.

If you are feeling adventurous, try writing in R Markdown, using RStudio as a text editor GUI (Graphical User Interface) and the \href{https://bookdown.org/}{Bookdown} platform to publish your chapters into a single thesis file in virtually any format. There is also great support for both of these formats with free guidebooks about how to use them \citep{xie2016bookdown, xie2018r}. Given that I wrote this book in R Markdown with bookdown, I feel that I should point out (albeit briefly) the advantages to this platform:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Reproducibility
\item
  Dynamic Content (include statistical code and graphics inside your thesis)
\item
  Focus on content (not formatting)
\item
  Numerous output types
\item
  Independent reference manager (via .bib file) and style files (via .csl file)
\item
  Free software and community support
\end{itemize}

Importantly, what you want to try to avoid is conducting a major switch between software right at the end of your PhD. Try making such changes when you have more time, like when you've just finished.

\hypertarget{naming-versions-of-files}{%
\subsection{Naming versions of files}\label{naming-versions-of-files}}

Good file management is an important aspect of a PhD. I like my students to give each chapter of their thesis a nickname or short running title that we both agree on to name the files. An example might be ``Swimming\_performance\_V1.rft''. The reason why I don't like ``Chapter\_1.rtf'' as a filename is that every student has a chapter 1, so I can't distinguish between them. In addition, I'm not good at remembering which chapter is chapter 1 and which is chapter 2. Sometimes, towards the end of a thesis, the chapters get switched around anyway, causing even more confusion. Notice that I don't like having spaces in filenames. This is a hangover from old days of MS-DOS, but is consistently useful today when using R and other coding software. However, some software platforms react oddly with underscore (\_), and so you might need to work with a hyphen instead of a space (-).

Once I've commented on a file and sent it back in an email, or uploaded it to their folder, I'll add my initials Swimming\_performance\_V1\_JM.rtf. Each time I comment on this version, I will add a number to my initials and the student adds one back, so eventually we might come to: Swimming\_performance\_V1\_JM3\_MM2.rtf. After three rounds, we would normally send a clean V2 out to co-authors and once their comments are back in we should be all set.

While you and your advisor can adopt any naming convention you like, you and they need to instantly be able to distinguish between a new version and one that they have already commented on by the file name.

\hypertarget{how-many-versions-of-each-file-should-you-keep}{%
\subsection{How many versions of each file should you keep?}\label{how-many-versions-of-each-file-should-you-keep}}

I would suggest keeping at least one older version of each file to minimise the possibility of losing the content through corrupt files, but you should also be keeping those \emph{.rtf or }.txt files as well, just in case. Because of my early experience with file corruption, I started to keep all versions of files. This is unnecessary, and I've never needed to go back to anything but the last version. Nevertheless, text files take up very little space and it's not a problem to keep more versions if you want to.

\hypertarget{paywall}{%
\section{How to get around the paywall}\label{paywall}}

Once you've understand where the money for science and publishing comes from, you will understand that there is no real shame in trying to access papers that are behind a paywall. Essentially, I'm going to recommend that you move from legitimate to illegitimate, and then if all else fails to get an interlibrary loan. This is last on the list as someone will have to pay for it. Your library may have an allocation that they can use before the bill comes to your advisor's desk.

\hypertarget{go-to-your-library}{%
\subsection{Go to your library}\label{go-to-your-library}}

Unsurprisingly, this should be your first port of call. It's probable that your library has an electronic portal that you can use to access all of their subscriptions. But don't forget that they have stacks with old copies and you might need to physically enter the building. Try it. They are great places!

Google scholar has lots of links (on the right) labelled with ``{[}pdf{]}'', and these are often integrated with your library. If there's nothing at first, click on the ``All 9 versions'' link (below and to the right). This may reveal that there is more than one version with a pdf, and you might have access to one of the others. Check for a link to the author on google scholar, and then look for a link to their website.

\hypertarget{taxonomy}{%
\section{Scientific names and taxonomic authorities}\label{taxonomy}}

There are quite a few conventions that it's worth being aware of when it comes to using names. When talking about common names, it is a bit of a quagmire as there are few standards that are followed by all journals. Scientific names can also be in great (taxonomic) flux, but at least there is definitive help. Here I will outline my interpretation of what's what in using names.

\hypertarget{scientific-names}{%
\subsection{Scientific names}\label{scientific-names}}

There is only one valid scientific name for a species. This is expressed in a binomial: two names, first the genus (with an initial capital letter) and then the species name (lower case). This name is italicised by convention (or in some cases underlined). Note that no other taxonomic names (e.g.~Family, Order, Class, Phylum) are written with italics (although they all get capital first letters), only the genus and species are italicised. The single name is a hard rule as taxonomy can't survive in any other way. The most recently published version is the one to use, but happily with many vertebrates \href{https://www.mammaldiversity.org/}{mammals}, \href{https://avibase.bsc-eoc.org/avibase.jsp?lang=EN}{birds}, \href{https://www.fishbase.se/search.php}{fish}, \href{http://www.reptile-database.org/}{reptiles} and \href{http://research.amnh.org/vz/herpetology/amphibia/}{amphibians} there are well curated databases to which you can refer for the latest taxonomic treatments. Also see \href{http://www.marinespecies.org/}{WoRMS} for marine species. My suggestion is that you defer to these (with citation) and you won't go far wrong. If you do this early on in your thesis, remember that you may need to update it later.

\hypertarget{consider-this-example}{%
\subsubsection{Consider this example:}\label{consider-this-example}}

When my former student, Mohlamatsane Mokhatla, started his PhD in 2013 he worked on three species, and over time these changed so that at various points in his thesis. You can see the combinations he had to contend with in Table \ref{tab:taxonomy}.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}

\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

The taxonomy of two species changed such that he had to constantly revise the names in his thesis. Luckily, he could simply conduct a ``replace all'', but it did become quite confusing. There's a chance that they've changed again, so I've provided hyperlinks for you to check out what the current name is. The lesson is that if you want to avoid this, work on \emph{Xenopus laevis} or conduct your PhD in as short a time as possible!

In taxonomic papers, and certain journals with a taxonomic focus, there is an insistence that you cite the ``taxonomic authority'' after the species name when used for the first time. This is essentially a citation in which you acknowledge the original description that accompanies the name. Let's take Mohlamatsane's examples again:

\begin{quote}
\emph{Sclerophrys capensis} Tschudi, 1838\\
\emph{Amietia delalandii} (Duméril and Bibron, 1841)\\
\emph{Xenopus laevis} (Daudin, 1802)
\end{quote}

It might seem that there's a mistake above, because Tschudi, 1838 isn't in brackets. This is actually deliberate. Tschudi, 1838 isn't in brackets because the genus name hasn't changed since the description by Tschudi \href{tschudi1838classification}{1838} placed \emph{S. capensis} in \emph{Sclerophrys} in 1838. But it is clear in the table above that the genus name did change to \emph{Amietophrynus}, and it was recognised under a different species name (\emph{A. rangeri}). Unlikely as it may seem, the original description of the species was by Tschudi in 1838, but this was long forgotten (or ignored because the type specimen was so poorly preserved), and the species was regularly referred to as \emph{Bufo rangeri}. When the genus \emph{Bufo} was broken up into lots of newly named genera by Frost et al \citeyearpar{frost2006amphibian}, Tschudi's description was once again disregarded \citep{ohler2016identity}. However, in 2016 new work on the type specimen revealed that it was the same as \emph{Amietophrynus rangeri,} but because Tschudi's description was older, the taxonomy deferred to the rule of precedence. If you want to read more about it, you can look at all the changes on the AMNH amphibian database.

To clarify, the use of brackets around the taxonomic authority only happens when the species is no longer in the genus in which it was originally placed by the person who described the species. Daudin \citeyearpar{daudin1802histoire} originally described \emph{Bufo laevis}, and Duméril and Bibron \citeyearpar{dumeril1841erpetologie} originally described \emph{Rana delalandii}. Hence you will see that both of these authors are within brackets after the names of their respective species.

The generic name of a Latin binomial is often abbreviated to the first letter (e.g.~\emph{X. laevis}). This should only be done once it is well established in your writing what the full name is. Or, in other words, you should refer to the species in full on the first mention, and then switch to the abbreviation. Because sentences shouldn't start with an abbreviation, you might need to relax this from time to time. You also need to treat the abstract as a stand-alone document in this respect. You might find that you have two species, which belong to different genera that share the same first letter. In this case, most authors use a different abbreviation: for example \emph{Ap. rangeri} and \emph{At. angolensis}. This is exasperated when both species names are the same. Keen readers would have noticed that Mohlamatsane doesn't have this problem any more!

I have seen some comments that suggest that once a generic name is abbreviated in a paper, it shouldn't be written in full again. In my opinion, this is rather a silly idea. It is up to you (the writer) to avoid ambiguity. If there is no ambiguity, then you may write the genus and species in full to increase the readability of your piece.

You should not start a sentence with an abbreviated genus. \emph{X. laevis} would not be good, because your first word of the sentence is abbreviated (\emph{X.} ). \emph{Xenopus laevis} is a perfectly admissible way to start a sentence.

Lastly, there is a convention that when referring to the generic name alone you should always mention that it is a genus. So you shouldn't write about those \emph{Bufo} that hop around the house, but instead about those members \textbf{of the genus} \emph{Bufo} that hop around the house.

\hypertarget{different-codes-for-the-nomenclature-of-different-taxa}{%
\subsection{Different codes for the nomenclature of different taxa}\label{different-codes-for-the-nomenclature-of-different-taxa}}

Nomenclatural codes exist to ensure stability in names. At first glance, this might seem like quite a trivial (academic) matter. But think about what happens when a particular species is named in law. That name could (in theory) be changed by some unscrupulous biologist to open up a legal loophole, or at least some ambiguity. Once you are aware what can go wrong with taxonomy and the implications that it can have on many lives, you will understand the need for stability. Happily, there are associations of very serious people who guard the stability of taxonomy through the codes. It is important to realise that there are codes governing the naming of different levels of taxa.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Viruses -- \href{https://talk.ictvonline.org/information/w/ictv-information/383/ictv-code}{International Code of Virus Classification and Nomenclature}
\item
  Bacteria \& Archaea \href{https://www.the-icsp.org/bacterial-code}{International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes}
\item
  Algae, Fungi \& Plants \href{https://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php}{International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants}
\item
  Animals \href{https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/}{International Code of Zoological Nomenclature}
\end{itemize}

There are many peculiarities for each taxon, and if your PhD involves taxonomy explicitly you should consult the specific code. Otherwise, it's unlikely that you'll need to be aware of the contents of each or any code.

\hypertarget{peculiarities-of-plant-taxonomy}{%
\subsubsection{Peculiarities of plant taxonomy}\label{peculiarities-of-plant-taxonomy}}

Plant taxonomy is considered the taxonomic mother discipline as the work of Linneaus in 1753 was the first botanical work that consistently used Linneus' binomial (two names: Genus species) nomeclatural system \citep{linnaeus1753species} which pre-dated the more inclusive (and better known) landmark publication in 1758 \citep{linnaeus1758systema}. In addition to the Latin binomial name (Genus and species), plants (and some other taxa) often require further descriptors or \textbf{ranks} that denote subspecies, varieties, subvareties, etc. I have included a (non-exhaustive) list of these in Table \ref{tab:plantrank}, together with some examples.

Because Linneaus named so many plant species is his landmark publications, instead of writing out the full taxonomic authority after the species names, botanists abbreviate this to ``L.''. Like Linneaus, other prolific plant taxonomists can have their names abbreviated, but plant taxonomists became so numerous that there needed to be some standardisation of names and their abbreviations. A database of these \textbf{Standard Forms} can be found at \href{https://www.kew.org/data/authors.html}{the International Plant Names Index database}. Note that Standard Forms in plant taxonomy can include initials.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}

Some plants exist in associations (such as lichens which are an association between an algae or cyanobacteria and one or more fungi. For these associations there is a specific code for their nomenclature: International Code of Phytosociological Nomenclature \citep{theurillat2021international}.

There is also a code for cultivated plants, and if you study any kind of agronomical system, you will be familiar with not just the normal binomial name, but also a specific cultivar or variety (\emph{var.}) that follows the binomial: \href{https://www.ishs.org/scripta-horticulturae/international-code-nomenclature-cultivated-plants-ninth-edition}{The International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants}.

\hypertarget{common-names}{%
\subsection{Common names}\label{common-names}}

Common names have a different set of problems to those that we've seen for scientific names. These are largely focussed on: what name to use, and whether or not to capitalise the common name.

What name to use - This is tricky. My suggestion would be to take the most commonly used common name, as that's likely to be the one that most people will recognise. However, it's not always that simple and because there's no ``correct'' common name, you have some leeway to choose the one you prefer.

Let's take an example: The African Clawed Frog is a very widely used name for \emph{Xenopus laevis} which is used all over the world as the model amphibian. However, African Clawed Frogs is also the commonly accepted name for the entire genus, \emph{Xenopus}. Thus, shouldn't we avoid using this for the species \emph{X. laevis}? So, let's look at the alternatives. Frost \citeyearpar{frost2020amphibian} lists 13 common names for this species. Names such as Platanna and Common Platanna are difficult to use in scientific papers as they are only regularly used in South Africa. Clawed Toad is not appropriate, as it is not a toad (reserved for members of the family Bufonidae), a confusion that dates right back to Daudin's 1802 description. Clawed Frog has the same problem as African Clawed Frog, and other variants such as Upland Clawed Frog and Smooth Clawed Frog also seem inappropriate as this species is neither confined to uplands, nor the only member of the genus which is smooth (although `laevis', the species name, does mean `smooth').

There has been a recent movement to formulate common names into genera (or even families) such that the specific common name takes on a specific epithet of the generic or familial common name. In a world of stable taxonomy (such as that enjoyed by ornithologists), I can understand that this is possible. But imagine the requirements in common name changes for Mohlamatsane in his thesis over only a few years. Surely the useful thing about common names is that they are used commonly by normal people who don't worry about taxonomy? If we insist on common names constantly changing, don't we risk alienating the public?

I eventually decided to use `African Clawed Frog' as this is the most widely recognised common name for this species. It does become an issue when writing about \emph{X. laevis} and other \emph{Xenopus} species (as we have), but we've managed to resolve this without too much difficulty.

\hypertarget{should-common-names-have-capitals}{%
\subsection{Should common names have capitals?}\label{should-common-names-have-capitals}}

\textbf{Warning: lots of people get very upset about this point and there are two views:}

\hypertarget{view-1.}{%
\subsubsection{View 1.}\label{view-1.}}

Common names are proper nouns and proper nouns start with capitals. The Western Leopard Toad is not any toad, and the African Clawed Frog isn't any frog. The Cape platanna is any platanna living in the Cape, but the Cape Platanna is \emph{Xenopus gilli}! In this last example, you can see how capitalisation reduces ambiguity and differentiates between adjectives and nouns.

\hypertarget{view-2.}{%
\subsubsection{View 2.}\label{view-2.}}

Common names are not formal names (like scientific names) so why does it matter? Many journals do not capitalise common names and insist on lower case unless they are proper nouns, like African in African clawed frogs. This seems to have arisen from editors who dislike superfluous capitalisation.

On balance, I'd say that it's likely that your usage will be dictated by the policies of your faculty, advisor or journal.

\hypertarget{style}{%
\section{Writing style}\label{style}}

\textbf{Did you ever feel that reading a paper was like trying to solve a puzzle?}

During my PhD I read a lot. My study species was the subject of tens of thousands of papers, and I was convinced that I'd find what I'd need somewhere in those musty old reprints and heavy volumes that came from the library shelves. It was easy to believe that the authors of those papers had set great puzzles for me to try to understand their content. The realisation that this is not the best form of communication came as a personal epiphany some years ago.

\begin{quote}
``The goal of good writing is straightforward: to make your reader's job as easy as possible''
Kevin W. Plaxco \citeyearpar{plaxco2010art}.
\end{quote}

This great quote from a paper by Plaxco \citeyearpar{plaxco2010art} cuts to the heart of why it's essential to write well. As an editor, I once experienced an author who thought the opposite, and for me this was an epiphany. The submitted manuscript was an impenetrable mess. I could tell that there was good work in there, but as an editor I felt that the information had been made so obscure by the authors that my readers were unlikely to get much out of it. The author was a colleague, and so I decided to phone him and chat about the need for much greater clarity in his manuscript. Experience with email has taught me that they can often be taken in the wrong way; usually in the worst possible way.

The response I got surprised me. The author recognised that his text was dense and was unapologetic. ``Let the reader work to make sense of my data,'' he said. My epiphany came not because this was a totally alien concept, but because during my PhD days this was exactly how I had thought scientific writing should be done. I had spent so many hours slogging through dense and dreary papers by well-respected figures. The reward when I finally understood what it was that they were trying to communicate felt so great that I believed the puzzle they had set me was what I should set my own readers. Happily, my advisor didn't feel the same way, but for years I continued to believe that a paper should be a decent puzzle for my readers to crack. This might seem a crazy concept, but it's not an uncommon problem. For a great take on this in Chemistry, see this great article by Murray \citeyearpar{murray2011skillful}.

This has led to a general perception that ``academics stink at writing'' - as Steven Pinker put it. But, I think that Pinker is outdated. Certainly, as Plaxco \citeyearpar{plaxco2010art} has it, there are a lot of ways that academics can improve their writing, for each other. But the belief that all academic writing is going to be accessible to the general public is far fetched. This is because there are a lot of terms when writing journal articles that are there for precision and brevity. These terms will exclude a larger audience, especially when they get so dense that looking them up is simply too arduous. What Plaxco \citeyearpar{plaxco2010art} urges us to do is to make the rest of the text as accessible and easy as possible.

Any good writing is an artform, and that includes good academic writing. You can't expect to be the best until you've spent some time at it.

There are still authors out there who attempt to set puzzles for their readers, but they aren't in the mainstream any more. Instead, biological sciences has some inspiring writers, and many more are taught how to inspire future generations towards communicating great science. That's not to say that there are no puzzles left. Much of what we do requires great puzzle solving abilities. However, let's keep the puzzles away from communicating with our audience, make their job as reader easy or even pleasurable, and they'll keep coming back for more.

\hypertarget{dont-bamboozle}{%
\subsection{Don't bamboozle}\label{dont-bamboozle}}

It's easy to use jargon. The whole point of jargon is to convey a (usually complex) idea in a short amount of space. Using a word (or two) instead of using several sentences clearly has some advantages. However, there is such a thing as too much jargon. Simply put, it's unnecessary to use jargon when you can use plain English in the same amount of space. My old tutor at Liverpool University, the late, great Brian Moss, shared the following example of too much jargon \citep{bump2009large}, when plain English would have been much shorter. Do yourself a favor and read the abstract of Bump et al \citeyearpar{bump2009large}. The fact that it gave Moss a chance to write about moose wasn't lost on anyone (see Figure \ref{fig:moss})!



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/moss} \caption{\textbf{Bamboozled Moss takes on the moose.} Brian was so unhappy after reading Bump et al (2009) the above that he felt compelled to write a letter to the British Ecological Society Bulletin.}\label{fig:moss}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{voice}{%
\section{When is it possible to retain your own voice when writing?}\label{voice}}

Should one use ``I'' or ``we'' when writing a scientific paper? Although there was a tradition not to use first-person pronouns when writing scientific articles, this has fallen by the wayside in recent years as the use of I or we makes writing simpler for writers and readers. Use ``I'' if you are the sole author (or in your thesis) and ``we'' for two or more authors.

You will regularly see ``I'' or ``we'' being used in the last paragraph of the introduction and the first paragraph of the discussion. It's also quite common to use this in the methods section. The reason why these sections have ``I'' or ``we'' is quite obvious, as it allows you to place your own voice on actions and decisions. After all, it is your aim and hypothesis for your study, so you should own it. Using first-person pronouns also allow you to be more concise, and there are some great examples here where you can see what happens when you don't use them.

The first use of ``I'' or ``we'' at the end of the introduction is powerful. Up to that point, the reader has read four or five paragraphs of logical arguments outlining the background information that makes up the reasoning for your study. Using the first-person pronoun now makes the reader sit up as they have you communicating directly with them what you aimed to do. But that power is lost with repetition. So if you were to continuously use it throughout the methodology, the reader may get tired of reading a string of statements stating that you did this, then you did that, and so on. The power of using ``I'' or ``we'' is to use it sparingly to boost clarity.

\hypertarget{does-writing-i-or-we-help-people-to-understand-who-you-are}{%
\subsection{Does writing ``I'' or ``we'' help people to understand who you are?}\label{does-writing-i-or-we-help-people-to-understand-who-you-are}}

Actually, all of your writing will do this. As long as you are using your own words (and not plagiarising), your writing is likely to be unique to you and hence recognisable as you. It never ceases to amaze me that it is possible to convey the same information in so many different ways. Your way will likely change with time and experience, but remain yours throughout your writing life. If you keep writing, people will be able to recognise your distinct style.

\hypertarget{the-vonnegut-advice}{%
\subsection{The Vonnegut advice}\label{the-vonnegut-advice}}

Kurt Vonnegut \citeyearpar{vonnegut1980how}, infamous novelist, provided some advice for writers. First, he made an impassioned plea for technical writers (yes, you) to use your own writing style. The easiest way, Vonnegut argues, is to write about a subject that you care about. He's totally correct on this, and I'm hoping that after all your research you care passionately about your subject. Next, not to ramble, but to keep your writing simple.

What is most impressive about Vonnegut's advice is that he argues from the readers' standpoint. His parting advice:

\begin{quote}
``Our audience requires us to be sympathetic and patient teachers, ever willing to simplify and clarify - whereas we would rather soar high above the crowd, singing like nightingales.''
Kurt Vonnegut
\end{quote}

Having said that you should write about subjects that you feel passionately about, this does not mean that you should write with unsubstantiated passion. For example, it makes no sense to write: ``The threats to this spectacular species surpass any mechanism known to humankind'' \ldots unless you have substantive citations or results to back this up. Yes, it's passionate, but that should be balanced by the need to keep what you write factual.

\hypertarget{concise}{%
\section{Writing concisely}\label{concise}}

So far, I have put an emphasis on a writing formula in order to get started writing. Many students have a problem in knowing where and how to get started with what seems to be a daunting prospect: writing a proposal or writing the entire thesis. I still feel that getting started quickly and efficiently with some confidence is one of your most important steps. But once you've made it through your first draft, you'll begin to find that you need to start refining your writing. That is saying what you need to say in less words and space.

In an ideal world, what goes into your thesis will be of the same quality as the accepted manuscript. The reality is that the thesis is often more wordy, with the result that reviewers and/or editors will ask you to be more concise. How can we achieve this?

Someone else has written a great essay with 10 top rules to help you be concise. The essay is Open Access, and there's no need for me to repeat the words of Scott Hotaling \citeyearpar{hotaling2020simple}. However, I am going to write some comments of my own on his rules. There are some other posts that are also worth a second look along with this one: see here and here.

Here, the rules are Scott's, the comments are mine:

\hypertarget{rule-1.-take-writing-seriously}{%
\subsection{Rule 1. Take writing seriously}\label{rule-1.-take-writing-seriously}}

It is likely, that like me, you chose to do science at school instead of useful subjects such as English and/or other languages. It might have also occurred to you that it was a really bad idea not to have done more earnest work in languages now that you are expected to write like a professional. Certainly, if you did pay more attention in languages in school, you may not be suffering with the rest of us now. Personally, I never received tuition in the grammatical construction of English. Thus I'm left in the dark most of the time about exactly what is wrong. Instead, I simply try to rework a sentence into what I know is correct {[}and I often don't achieve that{]}. The lesson then is that should you come across an opportunity to learn more about writing, do take it.
Although we talk about writing science here, the grammatical rules of writing (in English) are fairly universal (with some local exceptions), so do practice your writing. Maybe write a letter (or long email) instead of making a call sometimes. It'll also help you to read (see here). If you are a keen reader, then you could do worse than reading some Kurt Vonnegut. Scott provided this link to an article I hadn't seen before. Go on, give it a read!

\hypertarget{rule-2-identify-and-stick-to-your-message}{%
\subsection{Rule 2: Identify and stick to your message}\label{rule-2-identify-and-stick-to-your-message}}

It's important to avoid distracting your reader (see \href{part2.html}{Part II}). Your aim is to be thorough, which will mean including all relevant information, but don't allow your writing to sideline them into taking the wrong direction. You need to stick to your narrative like a highway. The highway analogy is useful as although you will see signs to other places that you can point out (to the reader), you shouldn't turn off the highway. The best of highways will also be free of traffic jams (think long, complex sentences here). and toll free (\href{paywall.html}{no paywall}).

This will mean that you may need to delete some of what you've written, and that can be hard (especially when they are the best bits). You can always keep a file with all the best bits that you've never used. Maybe one day you'll use them. Or maybe one day you'll see that they weren't quite as good as you thought they were.

\hypertarget{rule-3-get-to-the-point}{%
\subsection{Rule 3: Get to the point}\label{rule-3-get-to-the-point}}

If the highway is `your message' then getting to the point is the big sign that states the destination.

Some of the best papers I've read manage to encapsulate the whole point in the first sentence, or better still in the title. Our formula has you getting to the main question in the last paragraph of the introduction, but you should have already `got to the point' in the first paragraph - i.e.~the point that is the bigger picture.

\hypertarget{rule-4-keep-your-methods-and-results-contained}{%
\subsection{Rule 4: Keep your Methods and Results contained}\label{rule-4-keep-your-methods-and-results-contained}}

You can find a guide to writing your methods in \href{part3.html}{Part III}. This rule is about not allowing the methods to creep out of this section and into the results, or even the discussion. Similarly with the Results. There are some specific times when this is permitted (such as a post-hoc test), but generally you shouldn't expect to do this.

\hypertarget{rule-5-do-not-repeat-yourself-too-often}{%
\subsection{Rule 5: Do not repeat yourself (too often)}\label{rule-5-do-not-repeat-yourself-too-often}}

Redundancy is often rife in proposals, theses and manuscripts. If you've produced a table with all of the results, then they don't need to be in the text. The same with a figure, especially Figure 1 which is often a descriptive map or diagram of apparatus. Have it once, but you don't need it twice.

Copy and pasting is very easy, and a good way of suddenly producing vast quantities of text. But repeated text is quickly recognised by the reader and appears very boring and cumbersome. This is likely to happen in the Methods and Results sections. If you find yourself deciding that you can simply cut and paste this paragraph while changing the variable names and the numbers, then you are wrong. Don't ever do it.

Also, please don't cut and paste sections of methods from one part of your thesis to another. Just don't do it.

People also have a tendency to build the abstract by copying and pasting text from the main sections. Don't do it. The reader will quickly see the repetitions and become bored. Similarly, the conclusion/summary section is also often copied from lines above. If it's not worth writing again, then it wasn't worth writing before. Make it fresh, and keep it interesting!

\hypertarget{rule-6-avoid-unnecessary-or-inefficient-leadins}{%
\subsection{Rule 6: Avoid unnecessary or inefficient ``lead‐ins''}\label{rule-6-avoid-unnecessary-or-inefficient-leadins}}

Interesting. I'd say that you need some practice and a critical eye to spot these kinds of errors. Having your advisor help or someone who has edited a lot of text. Scott's got some great examples, and so I'll let you peruse them here.

\hypertarget{rule-7-use-firstperson-active-voice}{%
\subsection{Rule 7: Use first‐person, active voice}\label{rule-7-use-firstperson-active-voice}}

For some reason, most students avoid this at all cost. There appears to be the idea that saying ``I'' or ``we'' isn't correct for scientific writing. In fact, it can be the easiest way to avoid the passive voice. I've written more on this elsewhere\ldots{} see here.

\hypertarget{rule-8-remove-unnecessary-words}{%
\subsection{Rule 8: Remove unnecessary words}\label{rule-8-remove-unnecessary-words}}

This is really getting down to the nitty gritty. It's hard to do this yourself. It's much easier for someone else to show you. Typically I only do this level of word-smithing for abstracts or when the imposed word limit means that you really need to remove excess words. However, Scott is correct that if you can learn to do this yourself, it will improve your writing.

Personally, I like to slip in the odd `as well as' instead of `and', just to ring the changes. Scott would remove them, and you can see where he'd edit out other examples. Do we really have to be so hardline? I'd say that there are times when it helps.

\hypertarget{rule-9-simplify-your-language}{%
\subsection{Rule 9: Simplify your language}\label{rule-9-simplify-your-language}}

This is always a good idea. Making three short sentences instead of one very long one is much better. It also helps you avoid complicated grammatical clauses.

\hypertarget{rule-10-seek-and-embrace-feedback}{%
\subsection{Rule 10: Seek and embrace feedback}\label{rule-10-seek-and-embrace-feedback}}

I spend a lot of my time reading and commenting on the writing of my students. Every comment is made to improve the document. I do get mad when I find that this help is ignored without an indication why. My suggestions or comments are simply deleted. Certain students become very hard work when they don't even explain why they refuse to change something. You should have noted by now that it's all about being flexible, and being stubborn about anything you've written isn't going to work. Reading the work of these students quickly becomes a chore.

\hypertarget{rule-11-read-it-yourself}{%
\subsection{Rule 11: Read it yourself}\label{rule-11-read-it-yourself}}

Here's a rule that Scott didn't have. Perhaps it should have been inserted higher up the list. As I've said elsewhere (here for example), it would help you to have your work read through by one of your colleagues before you give it to your advisor. But above all, you must be prepared to read \textbf{all of your work} yourself. Not just the first time you write it, but for \textbf{every} version. Please don't ever expect your advisor to read something through when you can't be bothered to read it yourself.

Being concise is a great way to write well, and the abstract is a case in point.

Please don't forget to read Scott's 10 rules as written by Scott \citep{hotaling2020simple}.

\hypertarget{foreign}{%
\section{Writing a PhD if English is not your first language}\label{foreign}}

Reading this book you will learn of the many biases in biological sciences and how you need to be aware of them in order to properly interpret your work. Be aware also that biological sciences is biased in where studies take place, and who publishes them \citep{culumber2019widespread, nunez2021monolingual}. What we really need then are more studies from less studied parts of the world, and especially we need these to be researched and published by people from those countries. Why then do we insist that science be written in English?

English may be one of the most difficult languages to learn how to write as a foreign language because rules are so inconsistent, and the vocabulary is so large. At 171476 words, English has an enormous vocabulary, followed closely by Russian (150000), Spanish (93000) and Chinese (85568: although you should note that counting words isn't very accurate and as for counting dictionary entries, Korean wins). I cannot defend the use of English as the language of science, but I can assert that having a universal language for communicating science is massively helpful, and makes a large swathe of the literature available to those scientists who are prepared to become proficient in a second language. However, none of this really helps you to prepare writing in English as a second language.

One of my `pet hates' is that many non-English speaking editors seem to insist that you have your work checked by a `native English speaker' (see Figure \ref{fig:editor}). This suggests to me that some of the worst people to comment on whether or not something is written in good English, is another foreign language speaker. The lesson here is that you should be careful who you trust. Moreover, in my experience, having advice from a `native English speaker' is no guarantee to getting a well written chapter or manuscript. Most of the world's scientists did not grow up speaking English. Yet, rightly or wrongly, English is the language in which science is currently written. So, if English isn't your mother tongue, should you expect to receive help during peer review?

\hypertarget{message-from-an-editor}{%
\subsection{Message from an editor}\label{message-from-an-editor}}



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/editor} \caption{\textbf{The message from the editor: ``your work should be checked by a native English speaker''} Should you expect to receive help with your English when you submit a manuscript?}\label{fig:editor}
\end{figure}

Perhaps I should start from the outset by stating that English is my mother tongue, and that I have spent many hours correcting the language of colleagues for whom it wasn't. However, most of these hours were spent when I was a postgraduate student or postdoc. I no longer think that correcting English is my role either as an editor, reviewer or as an advisor.

As I've stated above, I did not study English, and would be the first to admit that my grasp of grammar and syntax is by no means perfect (those of you with better English will have picked this up by now!). I have read enough correct English to know when something is incorrect, but that doesn't mean that I know how to correct it. I have spent many long hours trying to decode what others have written, and in some cases this has involved me rewriting entire manuscripts. I still do this as a co-author, although I do remember asking one colleague to please send any further drafts in their native Spanish as it would be easier to translate than it would be to re-write.

The time component is at the crux of my reasoning why, as an editor, reviewer and advisor, I will not provide an English language service. It is both a time consuming and an unsatisfying experience. We all have our own voice, and correcting while maintaining other people's voices is a painstaking task. There's an entire profession that specialises in this (think translator). These days there are also services available from publishers to non-English authors to help them correct their English.

In addition, there turns out to be research suggesting why peer review is not the best way to improve writing \citep{shashok2008content}. Peer review works much better at screening technical content than it does at improving the communication of that content. And this agrees with the opinions of some non-English speakers who ask for editors and reviewers to concentrate on the science, a sentiment with which I agree.

Given that I'm not going to correct your English, what remarks would you expect me to make when reviewing a poorly written manuscript?

No matter how you might hope that it isn't true, a poorly written manuscript will not get a good review. If your reviewer is struggling to understand what you have written, this becomes the overall impression that they will likely pass onto the handling editor. I try to separate my difficulties with English from my review of the science. But this isn't always possible. Frequently, a poorly written manuscript will mean that I won't be able to understand why the research was undertaken, what was done or what it means. This is bound to impact the review negatively.

The more I struggle to read, the more negative the review becomes. I see this as inevitable. What shocks me is that some senior researchers consider it to be their right to submit poorly written manuscripts and have reviewers or editors correct them \citep[if you don't believe me, see][]{statzner2010negative}. Worse, I've received manuscripts that are co-authored by people I know are native English speakers, but are full of glaring mistakes that appear never to have been checked. For me, this violates the terms that all authors have approved the final manuscript.

But I've also got to admit that it's not easy. There are other places where you might be better to go to get advice on writing a paper or thesis as a second (or even more!) language \citep[see][]{firth2017writing}. I'm full of admiration for those of you that have to do this.

\hypertarget{must-a-native-english-speaker-check-your-work}{%
\subsection{Must a `native English speaker' check your work?}\label{must-a-native-english-speaker-check-your-work}}

Being a native English speaker, I am not above having people complain about my English. I do get it wrong, and my English can often be improved. I'm always happy to receive help, and see it as a sign of how I can improve the clarity of a manuscript. However, I hope that my manuscripts are never so poorly written that a reviewer or editor cannot make sense of them. So it is a matter of degrees.

There are many people who are not native English speakers who write far better than I do. My `pet hate' is that reviewers and editors insist that a manuscript must be corrected by a `native English speaker'. I've seen so many very poorly written essays, theses and manuscripts written by native English speakers that I know that having one correct your manuscript is unlikely to be of much help, unless they themselves are good writers.

Being a `native English speaker' doesn't automatically qualify you to write well, edit well or do any of the things that non-English speaking editors think that it does.

That non-English speaking editors often comment that a `native English speaker' should read my text, simply underlines the problem that many editors themselves are incapable of knowing whether or not something is well written.

Anyone you know who writes good English and is willing to help you. One option is the service offered by \textbf{AuthorAID} (\url{http://www.authoraid.info/en/}). Using AuthorAID, you can find a long term mentor who will help you with your English. You can read more about this approach here \citep{freeman2006publishing}.

Failing that, I'm afraid that the best route will be to pay for help.

\subsection{But surely my native tongue can be used for something?}\label{but-surely-my-native-tongue-can-be-used-for-something}}

Yes. It is essential that you use other languages to communicate your science with the wider community. Most of the world doesn't speak English, and so there is a real need for this to be done in your language. See a nice blog from the LSE on this subject here.

Lastly, consider the words of

\begin{quote}
Kurt Vonnegut \citeyearpar{vonnegut1982how}:
``No matter what your first language, you should treasure it all your life. If it happens not to be standard English, and if it shows itself when you write standard English, the result is usually delightful, like a very pretty girl with one eye that is green and one that is blue.''
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{plagiarise}{%
\section{Making sure that you don't plagiarise}\label{plagiarise}}

Essentially plagiarism is when you copy somebody else's work. We're most commonly familiar with plagiarism of writing and these days this is especially easy with the copy and paste function. Most people are not even aware that they have plagiarised because sometime in the past they copied and pasted the work of somebody else into a document and this later became incorporated into their text without them being aware of it.

Plagiarism is a problem because essentially you are taking somebody else's work without attributing it to them.

\hypertarget{how-to-know-if-you-have-plagiarised}{%
\subsection{How to know if you have plagiarised}\label{how-to-know-if-you-have-plagiarised}}

Today there are several pieces of software that are used to scan text that's written and available on the internet to discover plagiarism. One such example is Turnitin. One of the outputs of TurnItIn is to highlight text that matches other text already on the internet. As almost all journals published on the internet TurnItIn can accurately determine if text has been copied from another article or website.
I usually set TurnItIn to determine plagiarism with five or more consecutive words.

Remarkably it is very difficult to come up with exactly the same words that someone else used to describe a phenomenon. Most people when they think about it feel that it wouldn't be that surprising if they came up with exactly the same words as somebody else.

When caught plagiarising most undergraduates claim that they simply read an article and then later happen to write the same words that were in the article. They categorically deny that they ever copied or pasted text from the article into their work.

\textbf{Try it. When you try it you will learn what plagiarism is all about.}

Read an article, and then try to write text that is exactly the same as that in the article without looking back at the article itself.

Unless you have an eidetic memory you will fail at this task.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/plagiarism} \caption{\textbf{It's always tempting to copy and paste, but it is likely to lead to plagiarism.} Copy (Ctrl + c) and paste (Ctrl + v) have become so easy that it is tempting to pick up portions of appropriate text directly from papers and then slot them into our own work (Figure \ref{fig:plagiarism}). However, this is plagiarism and can easily be found by using software like TurnItIn. Most institutions will require checks for plagiarism on your thesis after submission, with dire consequences if your text fails.}\label{fig:plagiarism}
\end{figure}

This is not to say that no 5 or more words can ever be the same as someone else's. There are situations in which this happens. Think of addresses, quotes, certain laboratory equipment or protocols, and certainly references at the end of your paper. So there are many times when TurnItIn will come back with matching text. This is not what we're looking for in plagiarism.

\hypertarget{what-to-do-if-plagiarism-is-detected-in-your-work}{%
\subsection{What to do if plagiarism is detected in your work}\label{what-to-do-if-plagiarism-is-detected-in-your-work}}

It's remarkably easy to remove plagiarism from your work.

\textbf{Here's what you do:}
- Read the sentence that has been plagiarised several times to yourself.
- Now without looking at that sentence, write another sentence that has the same meaning. Because it's very hard to replicate somebody else's words without copying them, what you should find is that you've written a fresh plagiarised sentence.
- This can now be added to your text, changed as appropriately to fit your existing text. And that should be the end of your plagiarism worries.

\textbf{Here's what not to do:}
- Take the sentence swap out some of the words for synonyms and pass it off as your own.
- The sentence will still have the same structure that you copied and essentially this is still somebody else's work. Moreover TurnItIn will still recognise this as plagiarism.

\hypertarget{how-can-you-make-sure-that-you-never-plagiarise}{%
\subsection{How can you make sure that you never plagiarise?}\label{how-can-you-make-sure-that-you-never-plagiarise}}

Quite simply if you never cut and paste, you won't plagiarise. It's that easy. I understand why people copy and paste as a way to get started, or because someone else has written something so well, it's hard to believe that you could ever write it any better. But actually, you can write it just as well, and writing it in your own words is worth so much more.

Don't forget that the penalty for plagiarism in your thesis might well be that you fail.

It still seems amazing to me when I submit a student manuscript to TurnItIn and see that it is completely free of any plagiarism. There are so many words in English (\textgreater643 000 according to the Oxford English Dictionary) and so many different ways of putting them that you really can have your own writing style. Your writing style will be as unique to you as a fingerprint, and it will be entirely free of plagiarism. It's something you can celebrate.

\hypertarget{what-is-grey-plagiarism}{%
\subsection{What is grey plagiarism?}\label{what-is-grey-plagiarism}}

I would maintain that there is not really any grey area in plagiarism. So what are people talking about when they refer to a grey zone? The nominal grey zone within plagiarism comes when you copy your own text, this is sometimes referred to as self-plagiarism, but this also refers to the associated practice of `manuscript recycling' \citep{geraldi2021self-plagiarism}. Essentially this is really just the same as plagiarism but obviously if you are the original author then if you use your own text it's not the same as using somebody else's, because the work is still yours. However this is frequently complicated by multiple authors on a paper. For example, if I wrote a paper with five other people, even though the words were mine, if I use them again they would actually be attributed to all six authors and not just to me. Thus, if I use them again with five different authors it would still be plagiarism.

This is a particular problem in biological sciences (and some other sciences) when it comes to the methodology section (\href{methods.html}{see part 3}). Many students believe after having written the \href{methods.html}{Materials and Methods} once, they can't possibly write it again in another way. Actually, you can and you should. It's good practice, but remember that you can also cite the methods in a previous chapter. For example, chapter 2 has one method written out in great detail. Chapters 3 and 4 then reference chapter 2 while giving only a brief section on that methodology. You should already have seen some examples of how people do this in the literature, especially when citing their own previous work.

This is further complicated by having different publishers for your papers. Let's say I wrote a paper, I was the sole author and it was published by a journal that retained the copyright. If I use the same text again in another paper where again I was the soul author, but it was published in a different journal and they retained the copyright, that would be a breach of copyright to the first journal. It would be regarded as plagiarism.

Obviously, this situation really shouldn't occur because if you are the author of your own work then you should retain the copyright it should never be given to a publisher or a journal. The fact that many journals want to obtain copyright on work that they don't pay for is a complete disgrace but it's something that we're not going to go into right now (you can see rants here and here about science publishing scandals).

\hypertarget{manuscript-recycling}{%
\subsection{Manuscript recycling}\label{manuscript-recycling}}

Manuscript recycling is the practice of re-publishing the same manuscript (or with minimal changes) in different journals. Manuscript recycling is a bigger problem in other subject areas, notably economics \citep{geraldi2021self-plagiarism}, publishing issues in economics appear to need a lot more professionalism.

\hypertarget{overall---just-dont-plagiarise}{%
\subsection{Overall - just don't plagiarise}\label{overall---just-dont-plagiarise}}

The simple way around this problem is not to plagiarise any of your own text (self-plagiarism) or any of anybody else's. This is, as I've explained above, relatively easy because as long as you don't copy and paste any text you'll find it very hard to actually use somebody else's words. However it can get a little bit tricky when you are writing the materials and methods section of a paper, and especially when that paper uses exactly the same materials and methods as a previous paper. The temptation is great to go and copy the text that you've written before. But be aware that, however grey, this is plagiarism and you should not do it.

The likelihood is that because you're using the same names and their relationship is staying fixed as shown in the example above in materials and methods you are more likely to come up with text that a piece of software like turn it in will show is plagiarised even when it isn't.

\hypertarget{phrasebank}{%
\section{Academic phrasebank}\label{phrasebank}}

It can be really tough to get started writing especially if you are writing in English as a foreign language. It could be that the academic phrasebank is just what you're looking for.

When reading papers, I often come across the same phrases time and again. They seem so well honed to the situation that I'm envious about how the writer dreamt them up. Stealing them isn't quite \href{plagiarism.html}{plagiarism}, but then they don't regularly fit the exact situation that I'm looking for.

Imagine cutting and pasting them into a file, or even better a database that's ready for any eventuality. Banking them over time so that they are always available.

Then imagine that you did this and made it available to everyone\ldots{}

Well, John Morley has already done it, and he's made it available to everyone. The academic phrasebank is a fantastic resource:

It strikes me that this is going to be a fantastic resource for those of you who are not writing in English as your home language. And for those of you who just need a few words to get started. It'll also be useful when you are wanting to wordsmith your introduction or abstract.

Is it plagiarism? Given that the chapter before is all about not copying and pasting, am I now telling you that it's ok to copy and paste? Most of these phrases are less than five words or you will find that they are non-consecutive parts of a sentence. I don't think that most of these would constitute plagiarism if you pasted them into your document. However, I would suggest that you spend some time refining what you've written and that when you do that, some of these phrases may then come out.

\hypertarget{critical}{%
\section{Why critical reading is crucial for improving your writing}\label{critical}}

It is hard to emphasise exactly how important your reading will be, when it comes to your writing. If you are sitting with a blank page in front of you and feel that you have nothing to draw on, then think again. All of the reading that you have done to get to this point has already helped you more than you think. As I've pointed out elsewhere, your chapter or manuscript is likely to resemble the formula that many others already follow, and standing on the shoulders of those giants will help you again. But it's possible that your reading isn't helpful if you aren't being sufficiently `critical' when you read: and by critical I am talking about the methodical approach that you take to reading that improves your comprehension of a paper (Figure \ref{fig:Criticalreading}).



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/Criticalreading} \caption{\textbf{Critical reading is seen as being made up of five important aspects}. This diagram shows how each of the five aspects feeds into the next.}\label{fig:Criticalreading}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{making-notes-on-good-and-bad-styles}{%
\subsection{Making notes on good and bad styles}\label{making-notes-on-good-and-bad-styles}}

When you read, it's worth making all sorts of comments about what you're reading. It's tempting to think that the only aspects of a paper that you should take notes on are the science (questions, approach and findings), but this is only part of your mandate as a critical reader. Of course you should be taking notes on the science, but you should also be using it as an opportunity to learn tips and tricks of writing. Once you are actively writing, and I'd suggest that this should have been right from the very beginning of your studies, you should be actively thinking about how the authors are writing. Are they writing well? Are parts written poorly? Then the critical part is to cogitate, albeit briefly: what works, what doesn't and why.

Some papers will only offer the science that they contain. Others will stand out because you'll realise that you enjoy reading them. As a critical reader, your task is to decide why you enjoy reading a paper:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Is it the style?
\item
  Is it the way in which they formulate the logic of their argument?
\item
  Could it be that they've broken the standard formula?
\item
  Is it just the title, or the first sentence that you enjoy?
\end{itemize}

Once you've decided what it is, make these notes on the paper and file them on your referencing system (however you do it) under a style heading. I'd suggest that this be completely separate from your notes on the science. This is as simple as highlighting or making a quick note each time you see something that you like, or dislike (use different colours consistently). I used to underline text in pencil, and then make an illegible comment in the margin. It worked for me, not because I could read the comment, but because I could remember writing the comment.

You can also learn from badly written papers. Again, ask yourself exactly what it is about the writing style that doesn't work for you? If you don't know then comment in your database and make a group of papers that don't read well. Do they have anything in common?

It won't be every paper you read that you make notes about the style. It will probably only be a minority of papers in your area. However, this critical reading where you make notes on the ones that do stand out will help you greatly when it comes to your own writing.

\hypertarget{some-examples}{%
\subsubsection{Some examples}\label{some-examples}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Instead of using a taxonomic list (I don't like lists) and long citation string to describe lots of different studies that had previously made the same point, a co-author (in a recent review study) organised them all into the same categories we were presenting in a review. The result was that the reader was reminded of our categories at the same time as seeing how well others had already covered these same topics.
\item
  Being able to sum up a paragraph with a clincher sentence that also has a segway into the next paragraphs is a great skill to have
\item
  Some authors are able to generate a theme that they develop over several paragraphs or pages
\end{itemize}

If you've spotted what it is that you like, write it down and commit it to memory. The very fact that you start to see things in other people's writing that you like and admire means that you've managed to start reading critically. Keep this up, and it will help your writing no end as you open up your mind to critical reading.

You don't have to restrict yourself in what you can learn while reading other people's papers. Think about the stages in writing a paragraph. Look at the paragraphs you are reading and see if you can spot the subject and summary sentences. Maybe they are absent from the entire paper, or maybe they are present in every paragraph. Does it help enhance the readability of the paper? What about the times when authors break the rules? Can you see in your reading that the majority of authors follow rules? Do they follow the formula? What is the power in shaking it all up? If it works, try and analyse why it works. Then you will be reading critically.

When I started reading papers, I made photocopies (1 sided was as sophisticated as it got) from volumes of bound journal issues, and made notes in pencil on the back and front of those pages as I read. I understand that most of you will be working on pdfs which offer possibilities to add notes in text boxes that go alongside. But there still may be more advantages to writing notes using your own handwriting. A study by Mueller and Oppenheimer \citeyearpar{mueller2014pen} showed that students who typed retained less of the content from a lecture than those that made notes by hand. They showed that this was because those who used a keyboard tended to take notes that were more shallow, while those that wrote their notes had a deeper thinking. My take on this is that the brain is making extra connections when you are taking notes by hand. Those extra connections will benefit you when it comes to trying to recall the study.

Another advantage that making notes by hand brings you is that you can deliberately associate the location in which you read, and practice your handwritten notes, with the place where you want to eventually write and recall what you've learned \citep[see][]{bouton1993context}. Thus you can manipulate this facet of human memory to do all your learning, for example, at your desk in the department, or in the university library. Eccentrics may want to link it to reading in the bath, or another place of great comfort. But be careful not to make your `place' too specific. You could move house or have someone else allocated to your desk, and that wouldn't work out well. However you decide to make your notes, make sure that it works for you both in the present, and for the later stages of your PhD studies.

Similarly, if you make notes on style, you are likely to remember them in the same way that you remember the paper and its contents. An alternative to writing everything onto a printed copy is to make notes in a notebook. That way you get the advantage of building your memory with your own writing, and you can easily find everything in the same place when you forget where you read the fascinating insight. Alternatively, you may want to print the most important papers in your area, and make notes in pencil all over them.

It's important to emphasise that you should not copy and paste parts of someone's paper that you like. It's easy to do, but any copying could be your undoing if you later forget and paste your `notes' into your manuscript. It's so easy to plagiarise like this that the only way to really avoid it is by being very strict with yourself. Making notes by hand will force you to look away from the written text while you write, and you'll be unlikely to inadvertently copy anything. The advantages of writing notes by hand then make it greatly advantageous to restricting yourself to your computer (tablet or cell!).

\hypertarget{recognising-good-or-bad-in-what-you-read}{%
\subsection{Recognising good or bad in what you read}\label{recognising-good-or-bad-in-what-you-read}}

It's going to be hard to read and think at the same time. A little like walking and chewing gum, it comes with experience. And if you do fall over, stop chewing for a while and wait until you've got into your stride before having another go. Thinking is all part of the reading process, and while I agree that it might be hard to think on multiple levels while you read, it is possible. For example, consider what other worthy things you've thought about while reading this book. If you've not stopped to check your phone, or think about eating or drinking something, well done. It might be worth creating an atmosphere with less other stimulants while you read. If you only have your reading material and notebook, you'll be able to concentrate all of your thinking on them instead of getting distracted.

If you can't decide what it is that you enjoy from one paper, take it further. Take a look at the first author (likely to be the person responsible for the writing style). Have they written other papers, and do these have those same qualities? Or maybe it's the lab that they came from. Try to find the lab's pages on the internet and see if there are other inspiring papers there.

There is also a possibility that you are struggling to get insight with your reading because English isn't your first language. The subtleties of some of the usage of English may be passing you by. Because of the large number of words, it is possible to write something in English in many different ways. The overall aim is to convey the largest amount of information possible in the smallest number of words, while enhancing the context, meaning and readability. It's not easy, but the only way you'll ever get good is by starting, and reading and writing as much as possible.

If you are still struggling, a really good way forward is to start a journal club with your colleagues. It is probable that you aren't the only one who is having difficulties. There may already be a journal club in your institution which may (or may not) be a good place to go. What you do need is a safe space in which you aren't afraid to say when you don't understand. Think of it as a book club for scientific papers. After all, it may be that no-one understands and the paper is badly written. Alternatively, it can be that someone is able to help you quickly and easily. They can then give you extra insights into how and why they think the author is crafting their paper. This will then help you with your reading as well as your writing.

If you are looking for good fodder for your journal club, consider reviewing a preprint and publishing your review with a doi \citep{teixeiradasilva2017fortifying}. This will make the whole exercise a lot more worthwhile and produce a net output for your club.

\hypertarget{proposal}{%
\section{What is needed for your research proposal?}\label{proposal}}

In my institution, you need to have your PhD or MSc approved by a group of 3 independent staff members (i.e.~not including advisors) in your department. The department requires that your written proposal is publicly available to everyone in the department to look at (normally deposited in the secretary's office) at least 7 days prior to the oral presentation of your proposal. This is not unique to my university, many institutions require that you formally propose the work that you plan to do in a PhD. They may all have very different requirements. It is well worth checking out what your institution requires and by when. Talk to your adviser about this.

Your proposal is a collection of documents, where each document is a chapter of the thesis, and is roughly equivalent to a published paper. Ideally, these should be bounded by an introduction, which gives the bigger picture of how the thesis is placed, and a time-line at the end that demonstrates how you can complete the thesis within the two or three years for your MSc or PhD, respectively. Note that your project proposal is placed on your permanent file within the department.

\hypertarget{structure}{%
\subsection{Structure}\label{structure}}

We expect that your final thesis will be a set of papers (data chapters sandwiched between an introduction and discussion), and so we ask you to prepare the proposal in the same way. That is, you will normally have two (MSc) or five (PhD) data chapters. In the proposal, each chapter will consist of three parts:

\hypertarget{proposal-introduction}{%
\subsection{Proposal introduction}\label{proposal-introduction}}

I'm not going to go into what's inside the introduction here, as it's already been done in other chapters on formulaic writing (see later in this \href{formula.html}{part}) and specifically about the introduction (see \href{introduction.html}{part 3}). Although you may feel that there's no point putting a lot of effort into this introduction it serves as a literature review for your upcoming PhD study, and is well worth the time and effort.

\hypertarget{methods-and-materials}{%
\subsection{Methods and Materials}\label{methods-and-materials}}

What's in the \href{methods.html}{Methods and Materials} section is also covered here. Essentially you need to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Introduce important aspects of your study organism and/or study site
\item
  Describe exactly how you'll set up your experiment and/or collect your samples
\item
  You must explicitly state how each of the variables (introduced in the \href{introduction.html}{introduction}) is collected
\item
  (If necessary) Describe how you'll turn your collected data into the variables needed for your analyses
\item
  Data analyses (how you'll test your \href{hypothesis.html}{hypotheses}). This should include a description of the statistical or analytical techniques. It's useful to structure this section by each of the questions/hypotheses that you are posing
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{hypothetical-results}{%
\subsection{Hypothetical Results}\label{hypothetical-results}}

It's a very useful exercise to imagine how results will show that you have (or have not) accepted your hypothesis. You can't show results that would cover every eventuality, but give some typical scenarios that you think may happen if you accept and reject each hypothesis. This could be a bar chart, a map, a scatter-graph, etc.

\hypertarget{your-proposal---what-is-it-good-for}{%
\subsection{Your Proposal - what is it good for?}\label{your-proposal---what-is-it-good-for}}

Once you're done with your proposal, you might feel that you've done an awful lot of work without having added anything towards achieving your PhD or MSc. However, it's actually a really useful document that you can use in a number of ways:

\hypertarget{copy-and-paste-directly-into-your-thesis}{%
\subsubsection{Copy and paste directly into your thesis}\label{copy-and-paste-directly-into-your-thesis}}

One PhD student estimated that she pasted 60-70\% of her proposal text directly into her thesis. This included nearly all of the methods and materials section verbatim. Note that this \textbf{is not} plagiarism. You wrote the original proposal as a single author and it was not published, so you are at liberty to use the text again.

\hypertarget{use-it-to-raise-money-to-do-your-studies.}{%
\subsubsection{Use it to raise money to do your studies.}\label{use-it-to-raise-money-to-do-your-studies.}}

Writing grant proposals is essentially the same as your thesis proposal, and so you can use this document (with some modifications to tailor it to the grant objectives) to \href{funding.html}{raise money} for your work.

\hypertarget{deposit-the-proposal-to-conform-to-design-and-analysis-transparency}{%

This is the subject of another chapter (see \href{transparency.html}{part 3}).

\hypertarget{proposal-presentation}{%
\section{Making a presentation from your chapter, paper or proposal}\label{proposal-presentation}}

In theory, it couldn't be easier to take your written work, be it a research proposal, paper or chapter, and turn it into a presentation. Many people find presenting ideas easier than writing about them, as writing is inherently difficult. On the other hand, standing up in front of a room of strangers, or worse those you know, is also a bewildering task. In this section, the aim is to break down the task of making a presentation into a number of smaller steps so that you can tackle each one in turn and make sure that you are ready.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Give yourself plenty of time to prepare}
  Although your presentation might be weeks away, you are going to need \textasciitilde4 weeks to get the presentation ready, run it past your advisor (and potentially other co-authors), and practice your talk. As usual, my advice is not to leave it until the last minute to prepare as you'll get out what you put in.
\item
  \textbf{Know who your audience is and what they expect}
  If you have no idea of who your audience will be and what they will be expecting, then attend some other talks in the same seminar series, or ask your advisor and/or other lab colleagues for input. The more cross-disciplinary your audience is, the more general you should make your talk. If you've still no idea, pitch it for a very broad audience at last year undergraduate level.
\item
  \textbf{Be sure of exactly how much time you will have to talk}
  Be aware that your time slot might include time for questions, and so find out exactly how much talking time you have. If there is a long time set aside for discussion, you might want to throw some extra slides in that can help facilitate answering expected questions.
\item
  \textbf{Make sure you know the format of the presentation}
  If you don't know, then you can't make any assumptions about what might be present in the room where you give your presentation. I turned up to give my talk with a presentation on a USB drive only to find that there is no computer, no projector and a room of people expecting me to entertain them for an hour. Even if you know that a projector is present, it's good to have some extra context:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  for example is the computer Mac, PC or Linux;
\item
  should you bring your own laptop;
\item
  is there a pointer;
\item
  can it advance slides
\item
  If in doubt then bring your own accessories.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Know exactly where you are giving your talk and plan for plenty of travel time}
  Hopefully, you will be very familiar with the venue, and travelling to the venue will only involve a brief walk. I've made some rookie errors in the past, including deciding to cycle to the venue, getting caught in a cloudburst and arriving literally dripping wet (it was in the UK). The more comfortable you are with the whole setup, and the more organised you can be about getting yourself there without incidents, the better the talk will go for you.
\end{enumerate}

Essentially, you have a story to tell, but does not mean you are story telling. It means that your presentation will require you to talk continuously for your allotted period of time, and that the sentences must follow on from each other in a logical narrative; i.e.~a story.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  One slide per minute: However many minutes you have to present, that's your total number of slides. Don't be tempted to slip in more.
\item
  Keep the format clear: There are lots of templates available to use, but you'd do best to keep your presentation very clean and simple.
\item
  Be careful with animations: You can build your slide with animations (by adding images, words or graphics). But do not flash, bounce, rotate or roll. No animated little clipart characters. - No goofy cartoons -- they'll be too small for the audience to read. No sounds (unless you are talking about sounds). Your audience has seen it all before, and that's not what they've come for. They have come to hear about your research proposal.
\item
  Don't be a comedian: Everyone appreciates that occasional light-hearted comment, but it is not stand-up. If you feel that you must make a joke, make only one and be ready to push on when no-one reacts. Sarcasm simply won't be understood by the majority of your audience, so don't bother: unless you're a witless Brit who can't string three or more sentences together without {[}in which case you have my empathy{]}.

  Analyses are important. Make sure that you understand how they work, otherwise you won't be able to present them to others. Importantly, explain where each of the variables that you introduced, and explained how to measure, fit into the analyses. There shouldn't be anything new or unexpected that pops up here.

\subsection{Know your story first, and then make your presentation}\label{know-your-story-first-and-then-make-your-presentation}}

Despite previous sections \href{storytelling.html}{of this book} cautioning you against storytelling, you really need to have turn your study into a story in order to present it well. This means that you know what the message you want to reveal to the audience is. When you develop your story, be imaginative and creative. There are plenty of different styles to telling stories, and you should feel free to borrow styles that best fit your scenario. For example, you can reveal the punch line right at the beginning, and then work back through the presentation to show how you arrive there (but always try to keep something to reveal on the way there). Props are also excellent to produce in talks, something that you can bring with you, and show to an audience, that reveals more about your study. You want your audience to understand your story, but you also want them to remember it. Anything that will help them remember is likely to be a good prop.

In order to keep your audience with you, you need to produce reminders throughout the presentation. This could be themed images or colours that correspond to particular concepts, questions or ideas. If you get confused and can't work out how to present all of the information, then the chances are that your audience won't be able to keep track either. Slim down your study to something that will be easier to put to a story. Just like a real story, some things can't be left out, like characters (i.e.~variables) that you rely on to answer your questions. Don't take time to talk about anything off the prepared storyline, as you'll likely lose the audience or confuse them. Treat your main variables like characters that appear with some regularity and consist characteristics throughout the story.

Remember that you don't need to include every detail in your slides or your talk. If the audience can follow your story, but wants to know the details at the end, then they can ask questions about the details. Indeed, you can tell your audience precisely this as a way of side-stepping chunks of (especially) methodologies.

The audience is there to listen to you tell your story, and your slides (if you decide to use them), should be props that help you tell your story. Talk and interact with the audience to tell your story. Point to the slides to help you illustrate the points that you can't otherwise make, or to underline important points in your story. Above all, you need to make sure that the audience is listening to you tell your story.

\textbf{Fewer words are better. Tell the story yourself using the props on the slide}

\hypertarget{slide-layout}{%
\subsection{Slide layout}\label{slide-layout}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Your aim is to have your audience listen to you, and only look at the slides when you indicate their relevance.
\item
  You'd be better off having slides without words, then your audience will listen instead of trying to read. As long as they are reading, they aren't listening. Really try to limit the words you have on any single slide (\textless30). Don't have full sentences, but write just enough to remind you of what to say and so that your audience can follow when you are moving from point to point.
\item
  Use bullet pointed lists if you have several points to make (Font 28 pt)
\item
  If you only have words on a slide, then add a picture that will help illustrate your point. This is especially useful to illustrate your organism. At the same time, don't have anything on a slide that has no meaning or relevance. Make sure that any illustration is large enough for your audience to see and understand what it is that you are trying to show.
\item
  Everything on your slide must be mentioned in your presentation, so remove anything that becomes irrelevant to your story when you practice.
\item
  Tables: you are unlikely to have large complex tables in a presentation, but presenting raw data or small words in a table is a way to lose your audience. Make your point in another way.
\item
  Use citations (these can go in a smaller font: 20 pt). I like to cut out the title and authors of the paper from the pdf and show it on the slide.
\item
  If you can, have some banner that states where you are in your presentation (e.g.~Methods, or 5 of 13). It helps members of the audience who might have been daydreaming.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Large font, symbols that are consistent, familiar themes and photos all make for a good slide}

\hypertarget{practice-practice-practice}{%

\tightlist
\item
  It can't be said enough that you must practice your presentation. Do it in front of a mirror in your bathroom. In front of your friends. It's the best way of making sure you'll do a good job.
\item
  If you can't remember what you need to say, write flash cards with prompts. Include the text on your slide and expand. When you learn what's on the cards, relate it to what's on the slide so that you can look at the slides and get enough hints on what to say. Don't bring flashcards with you to your talk. Instead be confident enough that you know them front to back and back to front.
\item
  Practice with a pointer and slide advancer (or whatever you will use in the presentation). You should be pointing out to your audience what you have on your slides; use the pointer to do this.
\item
  Avoid taking anything with you that you might fiddle with.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{transparency}{%
\section{Starting out transparent}\label{transparency}}

The scientific method requires us to pose a falsifiable hypothesis, design a controlled, rigorous and repeatable methodology, and report and interpret our results honestly. In theory, it's all pretty straight forward. I'd like to think that in a world where science is adequately funded, we'd have already reached a situation where transparency was endemic in the scientific system. However, science has not been so lucky, and where there are shortcuts, some people will take them in order to get ahead of others. One of the objectives of this book is to demystify what happens in biological sciences. In other words, the demystification in this book is only really needed because so much of what happens does so behind closed doors, and out of the gaze of less privileged scientists. As you read through this book, you will see countless examples of where things are not as they should be. I have always tried to insert solutions when I highlight problems, but these are admittedly piecemeal, rarely proven, and even in a best case scenario might be best thought of as temporary solutions. The logical antidote to all these shady scientific dealings is to turn to transparency.

We would do better moving to open and transparent science. The open science movement is gaining traction \citep{sullivan2019open}, and I hope that it will become the norm in the very near future. Those of you who are reading this now are likely to be students during an interim period prior to open science becoming mainstream. Therefore, you will be instrumental in adopting this process as soon as possible to ensure that science becomes a fairer place for scientists from all backgrounds, and with all results. The idea is that this will impact research all the way from planning to publishing in a set of \href{https://topfactor.org/}{Top Factors}, which are likely to be increasingly adopted by funders (see \href{https://youtu.be/MLbgSGA581Q}{here}).

In this book, I have tried to consistently encourage you toward transparent and open practices in science. Here my aim is to introduce this topic and provide an overview of the main areas in which you can currently make a difference by opening up your research. As the Centre for Open Science explains (COS: \href{https://youtu.be/9YuNGB3vNOw}{see here}), this will take a shift in the culture of the scientific community, which is why you need to understand and adopt a transparent approach from the outset of your research career. There are much better and more comprehensive guides and online resources so I encourage you to look through the literature cited here. Although I advocate hard for the COS, please be aware that this is not the only set of guidelines (see also \href{https://plos.org/open-science/preregistration/}{recent moves by the Public Library of Science}).

\hypertarget{preregistration}{%
\subsection{Preregistration}\label{preregistration}}

You will spend a considerable amount of time at the beginning of your PhD studies planning what you want to do. In many institutions, this will take the form of a formal proposal. It will be agreed with your advisor, and may well pass the inspection of a committee. You will put a lot of effort into reading the literature in order to ask the best hypotheses possible. You will design your experiments with rigor and control, and potentially redesign them after your advisor and committee comment. The effort put into your proposal is totally disproportionate if it's never looked at again. Yet, this document is of historical importance, because it says what you think before ever doing the experiment and collecting or analysing the data. Thus, it can in future prove that you were not conforming to confirmation bias, for example by \href{TypeI.html}{HARKing}: rewriting your hypothesis after getting your results in order to get a significant result \citep{kerr1998harking, forstmeier2017detecting}.

Confirmation bias is a problem in science because of the way that science is published. In brief, articles for journals with higher impact are regularly selected based on significant results. If you don't have that significance, they are unlikely to want to take your manuscript. For this reason, many scientists have sought to have significant results to report, and this is called confirmation bias. Confirmation bias is bad because it violates the assumption that we are answering the hypothesis that we started with, or it could cause scientists to manipulate their data until a significant result is achieved. For example another form of confirmation bias is p hacking: repeating tests with different approaches in order to a significant result. Rubin \citeyearpar{rubin2020does} gives a good list and set of explanations. As there are a lot of known ways in which researchers have been thought to deliberately or accidentally report false-positive findings, one solution can be archiving your intentions, referred to as preregistration \citep{forstmeier2017detecting} see Figure \ref{fig:preregistration}. If you register your proposal (or any research plan), you can present this historical document to a journal (probably 4 to 5 years later) to show that you have done what you planned to do (see \href{https://youtu.be/8QK2-udwoK8}{webinar on preregistration here}).

What have you got to lose? With a good proposal that you feel confident with, you have nothing to lose. By registering your proposal, you are most likely to gain, especially in the future if more journals require preregistered hypotheses and methods in order to submit to them. What this does mean is that you will need to do a good job of your proposal. This can be daunting when starting a new PhD, especially with respect to the analyses if you are not from a strong analytical background. Your proposal period should be time to make sure that your knowledge of analyses that you will do is sufficient. I would suggest that the best way to make sure that you are proficient is to obtain a working knowledge of how to handle a dataset such as the one you are going to generate in your experiment during your proposal period. If your lab already has similar datasets, borrow one. If not, generate some data that you can use.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/preregistration} \caption{\textbf{Preregistration of your research proposal is a step towards transparency in research.} Preregistering your proposal formalises the first review process, while publishing your manuscript formalises the second \citep[after][]{scheel2020registered}.}\label{fig:preregistration}
\end{figure}

What if new analyses appear during the period, or you are forced to change your experimental protocol. Certainly, most analytical software will be updated over the course of your studies, and some might be superseded. None of this is a real problem to your preregistered content. Logging the software that you intend to use will demonstrate the approach and type of analyses that you intend to take. While it is unlikely that you will ever be held to account for minor changes to equipment or protocol, things do change along the way. It doesn't mean that you won't be able to report your results, or that your research won't be viable. But it does mean that you will need to be transparent about why it changed. For this reason, it is a good idea to document the changes to your proposed research plan and why they happened. It is surprisingly easy to forget! There are some great tools on different platforms for adding this information, together with a timestamp so that it's clear when it was done.

Although at first sight, preregistration appears to confine you to only testing ideas that you had before you started a study, actually the opposite is true. When you preregister your proposal (or research plan) it places a time-stamp and therefore a historical trail on your ideas. If as you go along with your study you gain new insight and ideas, you can register these with their own time-stamp. When it comes to analysing your data, you use a separate section labelled ``exploratory analyses''. You can then apply post-hoc rules to these findings, which will not stop you from reporting them, but gets around the awkwardness of \href{TypeI.html}{HARKing}. This serves to reinforce the distinction between prediction and postdiction.

\subsubsection{Will preregistration of research eliminate the bias from science?}\label{will-preregistration-of-research-eliminate-the-bias-from-science}}

It is probably too early to tell \citep{rubin2020does}, but it is certainly a good place to start \citep{nosek2018preregistration}. The more researchers know and subscribe to \href{transparency2.html}{transparency} in their research, the more it will shift the culture in science for the better \citep{forstmeier2017detecting}.However, there are more biases existing in science, and the system needs buy-in from stakeholders to promote equity by eliminaion of bias.

\hypertarget{what-platform-should-you-use}{%
\subsubsection{What Platform should you use?}\label{what-platform-should-you-use}}

When choosing where to archive your proposal (or any of your data, analyses, etc.) there are lots of platforms to choose from: \href{https://bitbucket.org/product}{Bitbucket}, \href{https://figshare.com/}{Figshare}, \href{https://github.com/}{Github}, \href{https://osf.io/}{OSF}, \href{https://zenodo.org/}{Zenodo} and the list will undoubtedly grow. Making a decision about what you are going to use now may not require that you stick with this same platform for you entire career, but there are some things that you should consider:

\textbf{Here are some of the considerations that you should take on board:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What do people in your lab and institution use? It'll be easier to use the same platform as your advisor and other lab members
\item
  Some platforms require a subscription, check whether your institution is a member.
\item
  Avoid using any platform that is tied to a publisher.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Although it's not possible to future proof this (as publishers have been shown to buy up anything they think will help them control the academic market), you can check how the platform is set up and opt for those that are non-profit organisations.
  \item
    Other important aspects are ``open source'', free to use and access.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Can the platform function for more than one aspect of transparency?
\item
  As the need for transparency in science grows, it will become important to have more aspects of projects archived. Does the platform that you've chosen cover all the stages from conception to publication?
\item
  Is it easy to use?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Some of the platforms will be more intuitive to use, while others require a steep learning curve. Consider how friendly they may be to other collaborators, older advisors, etc.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Are the archives easily compatible with other platforms?
  Working across platforms might be important for your project, especially if you start with collaborators that are already using different platforms.
\end{itemize}

The platform you choose should work for you (rather than having you work for it). If you are someone who loves to have everything ordered and organised, then you'll love seeing this all laid out. If you aren't, then these platforms are going to be a massive help to getting all of your plans sorted. Make updating your platform a habit. For example, you could make sure that notes taken during meetings with your advisor on different projects are logged onto the platform. This way you both have a record of what decision was made when. Remember that you can choose what you make accessible to the outside world.

\hypertarget{transparency-as-you-move-forwards}{%
\subsection{Transparency as you move forwards}\label{transparency-as-you-move-forwards}}

There are a whole lot more transparency criteria that you will need to be aware of later on in your PhD when it comes to publishing. Becoming familiar with the entire process now will be to your advantage, so I encourage you to read more about this topic. Sullivan et al \citeyearpar{sullivan2019open} provide a nice overview about how to get started, but be sure to consult documentation at \href{https://osf.io/}{OSF}.

\hypertarget{funding}{%
\section{Generating funding for your PhD research}\label{funding}}

To be honest, writing a funding proposal is an art in itself and should be the subject of an entirely different book written by somebody else. What is written here is only really scratching the surface so I suggest that if generating funding for your PhD research is going to be a large part of your work then you should look for another book.

\hypertarget{funding-databases}{%
\subsection{Funding databases}\label{funding-databases}}

Funding is one of the most important aspects of doing science, and something that different emphasis is placed on in different parts of the world. In North America, in particular, graduate students are expected to be able to demonstrate that they are able to raise their own funds, as this is expected of them in their jobs as academics. No matter where you are, your CV will be greatly improved by showing prospective employees (or labs) that you can generate your own funding. North America has a lot of opportunities to apply for funding for all sorts of reasons. There are less opportunities elsewhere, but the pool of people applying is also smaller. There are now so many opportunities, that several databases exist to help you find appropriate funding for your particular situation.

I am only going to address some of these portals, and to quickly consider some of the major reasons why you might want to apply for funding.

\hypertarget{reasons-you-might-want-to-apply-for-funding}{%
\subsection{Reasons you might want to apply for funding:}\label{reasons-you-might-want-to-apply-for-funding}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  To improve your CV. Even if it's only a small amount of funding that you apply for, it will make your CV look better. You might also want to search for prizes. Academic prizes carry both money and that feel good, look good feeling that CVs need.
\item
  Your project is unfunded. If you are completely unfunded, or you have a bursary but no running expenses, then you are going to need money to do your work. The more work (particularly field work) that you want to do, the more money you'll need to raise.
\item
  Your project is funded, but you want to do more. If you want to do a lot extra (like side projects or paying assistants to collect extra data) then all of this is possible if you can raise some more money to do it.
\item
  You want to attend a conference or workshop. There are great opportunities for travelling around the world, but they cost money and international conferences are often very expensive.
  Publishing in Open Access journals. I find the idea of putting cash into the pockets of publishers abhorrent, but you may have little choice. There are some opportunities to get funding for OA publishing.
\item
  It is clear that without making an application, you won't get any funding. But where do you start?
  Databases. There are many databases, but here we'll mention 3 that are easy to use.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{mendeleyhttpswww.mendeley.com}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Mendeley:\url{https://www.mendeley.com/}}{Mendeley:https://www.mendeley.com/}}\label{mendeleyhttpswww.mendeley.com}}

This is probably my favorite. It's easy to use and apply or remove filters. You can use the same login that you have for the referencing software and SCOPUS.

\hypertarget{open-4-research-httpswww.open4research.eu}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Open 4 Research: \url{https://www.open4research.eu}}{Open 4 Research: https://www.open4research.eu}}\label{open-4-research-httpswww.open4research.eu}}

For this you'll need an academic email address to register, but you'll get access to their research database. It is nice and logical to use, and you'll find local and international funding opportunities.

\hypertarget{research-professionalhttpswww.researchprofessional.com}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Research Professional:\url{https://www.researchprofessional.com/}}{Research Professional:https://www.researchprofessional.com/}}\label{research-professionalhttpswww.researchprofessional.com}}

You'll need to create a login for this site, although you might get an in with your university address. This provides you access to what could well be the same database as those above. This is a slick database and relatively easy to use.

\hypertarget{opportunities-in-your-department-or-societies}{%
\subsubsection{Opportunities in your department or societies:}\label{opportunities-in-your-department-or-societies}}

Probably the most likely place to get funding is where you already have an ``in'' (where you are already known). This will include professional societies where you are a member, or your department or university. These places also have prizes, so it's good that you know what is on offer in order to benefit the most.

\hypertarget{fear}{%
\section{Fear of submitting written work}\label{fear}}

Many people feel nervous of handing in their written work, and feeling a little nervous is good. It shows that you care deeply about your work. However, when it gets so bad that you can't hand work in any more, then something has gone wrong. It is possible that you are suffering from \textbf{impostor syndrome}. This chapter is to help you overcome your fear of handing in your written work.

\hypertarget{impostorsyndrome}{%
\subsection{What is impostor syndrome?}\label{impostorsyndrome}}

Impostor syndrome is an experience you have when you believe that you are not as competent as you think others perceive you to be. It is not uncommon in many professions, and especially prevalent in academia \citep{clance1978imposter}. This is now widely recognised and there are lots of useful shared experience out there to read \citep[e.g.][]{dickerson2019how}.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/conflicted} \caption{\textbf{It is common to worry about handing in your work.} Many people feel conflicted about whether or not they should hand in their work. Is this part of imposter syndrome?}\label{fig:conflicted}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Are you fearful that your work won't be well received?
\item
  Is it really up to the standards that are required?
\item
  Could you do better if you just spent some more time?
\end{itemize}

These are all really common thoughts, and they go along with `imposter syndrome' for a lot of early career (and even older) academics \citep[\citet{hutchins2017what}]{woolston2016faking}. There are some important points to think about here:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Everybody has these ideas and you aren't alone
\item
  Handing in work and getting feedback is part of the learning experience
\item
  The fact that you care so much about your work and how it is perceived is a good thing. If you didn't care, then this would be a problem.
\item
  If you never hand anything in, you won't get your post-graduate degree
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{think-of-it-this-way}{%
\subsection{Think of it this way}\label{think-of-it-this-way}}

The process of writing is part of your learning process, and you aren't learning alone. That's why you have an advisor. While you think that there may be a great intellectual gap between you and your advisor, I can promise you that there isn't. But your advisor is an experienced reader. Hopefully, there have been many students who have benefited from learning with your advisor (talk to them about their experience). They already work with a lot of students and help those people to bring their writing to a level where it can be accepted by an academic community.

Like other members of the academic community, your advisor also has experience of receiving critical feedback about their written work. Sometimes it is painful and sometimes it feels personal. But getting feedback (or peer review) is a fundamental part of the publishing process. Talk to your advisor and other lab members about this process. Ask people how they overcame their fear of submitting written work.

\hypertarget{what-can-you-do-to-help-yourself-overcome-the-fear-of-submitting-written-work}{%
\subsection{What can you do to help yourself overcome the fear of submitting written work?}\label{what-can-you-do-to-help-yourself-overcome-the-fear-of-submitting-written-work}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Give it to a friend or colleague to read
\item
  Remember that most of what you write should be understandable to the majority of people who can read (think of articles in The Conversation as a reasonable reading/understanding level). This means that you can give your written work to fellow postgraduates and postdocs and ask for feedback.
\item
  Annotate your text with places where you are particularly unsure.
  If there's a certain part that you are struggling with, annotate it (add comment in word) and point out that you are struggling with this particular section
\item
  Ask for a meeting with your advisor
  You can sit down together with your advisor and discuss the points where you are uncertain before handing in the work. Or, after you've written it you can ask for a session when you are given verbal feedback
\item
  Produce a checklist
  If you specifically worry that there may be errors in what you write (grammatical, spelling, plagiarism), then make a checklist that you can tick off prior to submitting. Once your check list is done, don't mess with the written work again (or you could add more errors), just hand it in!
\item
  Set a deadline for yourself
  If you don't already have one, having a set of deadlines that you give yourself to give your writing to work to colleagues and hand in to your advisor. If you know that you aren't good with deadlines, share them with as many people as you can!
\item
  Provide yourself with a reward for submitting your work. Rewards are a really simple way of helping you to do things. They help simplify otherwise apparently complex fears.
\item
  Tell your advisor about your fears
  There's nothing like honesty. Your advisor may be able to cut you some slack, or might sit down with you and look at how the two of you can overcome this difficulty.
  If you have more than one advisor, there may be one who you are more confident to read your work, and you can suggest that reading is done in series (instead of in parallel - actually I'd advise this).
\item
  Talk to your advisor about what really gets you the most upset. If you can't do this face to face, then you could annotate it in a reply to their comment. The chance is that your advisor doesn't know how upsetting it is and you'll be helping them in their future interactions with students.
\item
  Ask your advisor about their fear of handing in and get them (and others in your lab) to share their stories. You might find that you have common ground to start sharing how these problems can be overcome.
\end{enumerate}

At the end of the day, this is teamwork. Either you and your advisor are a team, or there are a bunch of advisors helping you. It is in everybody's interest that the job gets done. Getting a line of dialogue moving with your advisor is essential, even if you have to arrange a meeting about a different subject and then introduce the problem later in the meeting. There are deadlines that need to be kept. You need to find a way of getting through the fear, and if it's going to be a persistent problem, you'll need to work out what works best for you.

\hypertarget{formula}{%
\section{Why use a formula to structure each chapter or paper?}\label{formula}}

Very few people can sit down at a desk and write an academic paper from beginning to end. For most of us it takes a lot of hard work over many weeks or even months to write something that can be submitted to peer review. In part two of this book I approach the writing of a chapter or a paper for peer review in the same formulaic way, and will refer to papers or chapters interchangeably.

Sometimes it seems that every paper I read is just repeating the same formula over and over again. I even tend to forget that it's there until someone breaks the mould. Breaking the mould produces papers that really stand out, captivating the reader straight away. So why aren't we writing those manuscripts every time we write a paper? Moreover, why don't we teach students to write standout papers that will captivate everyone. Should we really be teaching formulaic writing?

Here I argue that not only is writing to a formula good practice, but it's the best way to learn scientific writing. When you look to see who is writing those knock-out articles (i.e.~``broken mould''), the answer is that they are really experienced researchers who have written hundreds of papers, and (unlike some of us) in doing so have learnt the essence of great writing. Such greatness is not innate and comes rarely to any researchers (even those who have written hundreds of papers). That's why I suggest to my students that they follow the formulas that are by now well recorded in many blogs and websites on scientific writing.

There is another reason why writing to a formula is recommended. Not only is it easier, but because it is so common and widespread, it also gives the reader a familiarity with reading your work. This means that editors are able to skim through and find exactly what makes your work worth publishing, and it means that those who are only semi-interested are more likely to cite your work.

\hypertarget{so-what-is-the-formula}{%
\subsection{So what is the formula?}\label{so-what-is-the-formula}}

If we were in my office, at this point in the meeting I usually go to my white board and start drawing funnels (as a metaphor) and blocks. However, others have much better diagrams and here I've adapted an idea from Brian McGill's blog \citep{mcgill20165}. But you can also find other useful material in a paper by Sheela Turbek and colleagues \citeyearpar{turbek2016scientific}, and in a paper by Kevin Plaxco \citeyearpar{plaxco2010art}. If you are of the Twitter persuasion, you get lots of useful tips and links from WriteThatPhD and Write4Research.

The diagram below (Figure \ref{fig:formula}) is supposed to show the movement of a liquid medium from one vessel to another. This is to make you think of your readers' understanding moving fluidly from one section to another. The introduction concentrates the ideas into your particular approach, while the discussion allows the reader to understand how your results fit into the larger body of knowledge.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/formula} \caption{\textbf{Using a formulaic approach to writing your PhD chapter.} The formula of writing a paper or chapter that we will concentrate on in this book.}\label{fig:formula}

\hypertarget{my-take-on-how-to-write-a-formula-paper}{%
\subsubsection{My take on how to write a formula paper}\label{my-take-on-how-to-write-a-formula-paper}}

But what goes into the top, and perhaps more importantly, what comes out of the bottom? I'd like for the discussion to end in a greater understanding of the system for the reader. But maybe if we could also inspire the reader to read more, that would be a great result.

My suggestion is that you now go and read 5 relevant papers in your field and annotate them to see how well they fit into the formula described above. This will give you a practical idea of how the formula is put into practice.

\hypertarget{start-with-an-outline}{%
\subsubsection{Start with an outline}\label{start-with-an-outline}}

\textbf{So now that you've got the idea that writing to a formula is a good idea, what next? }
Next, I suggest that you begin to plan out your formula as a bullet-point outline. Start by writing a general sentence for the subject of each paragraph. Then use sub-points to plan each sentence within the paragraph. Lastly, annotate these with citations that you want to use. Personally, I'd prefer to see the bare outline, and then a fleshed outline before you start the writing proper. This would allow the advisor and student to get on the same page to be sure that what is planned is thought out.

Example of an outline draft of the \href{introduction.html}{introduction}:
This outline is taken from Measey et al \citeyearpar{measey2020cost}:

\textbf{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It is important to assess the impacts of invasive species from published studies in order to compare them

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Not all studies are equally rigorous
  \item
    Inferences from less robust studies should be treated with caution
  \end{itemize}
\item
  More complex study designs tend to result in greater power to detect effect direction

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Increasingly complex designs are likely to cost more money to conduct
  \item
    Researchers are likely to conduct cheaper (small scale) experiments before large landscape scale ones
  \end{itemize}
\item
  EICAT and SEICAT rely on studies carried out at scales that are appropriate to the invasive population

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Cheaper studies will result in impacts of lower magnitude, and/or confidence and not reflect the species' true impact
  \item
    Poorer regions of the world might be expected to produce impacts of lower magnitude
  \item
    But EICAT is used to inform policy
  \end{itemize}
\item
  There is evidence of inequality in existing impact assessments of birds and amphibians

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    geographic disparity for birds
  \item
    This could come from funding disparities
  \item
    how can we achieve a representative impact level for all alien species, without enough peer reviewed studies?
  \item
    will the impact score of species be independent of research costs?
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Aims

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Whether studies that result in higher impact scores cost more to conduct
  \item
    Whether impact is related to study complexity or time taken to conduct the study
  \item
    Whether EICAT and SEICAT scores demonstrate changes through time
  \item
    Whether different EICAT and SEICAT scores occur with equivalent confidence
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Materials and Methods}

Paragraphs are indicated by the solid dots, and points to make inside the paragraphs hollow dots.

In the above example, you may not know what EICAT and SEICAT are (they are scoring systems used for environmental - EICAT - or socio-economic - SEICAT - impacts of alien species), but I would hope that you can follow the broad argument of the introduction explaining why the study should be done.

\hypertarget{next-flesh-out-the-outline-with-citations}{%
\subsubsection{Next flesh out the outline with citations}\label{next-flesh-out-the-outline-with-citations}}

In the next stage, fleshing out, I ask that citations for statements above be added along with any examples. Below is an example of the citations added to paragraph 4 above.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There is evidence of inequality in existing impact assessments of birds, amphibians and plants with lots of DD species (30\%; Evans et al.~2016; 38\%; Kumschick et al.~2017; 79\%; Rumlerová et al.~2016)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Geographic disparity for birds (Evans and Blackburn 2020)
  \item
    Examples of birds from Evans et al (2020)
  \item
    This could come from funding disparities
  \item
    How can we achieve a representative impact level for all alien species, without enough peer reviewed studies?
  \item
    Will the impact score of species be independent of research costs?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{lastly-its-time-to-write-the-text}{%
\subsubsection{Lastly it's time to write the text}\label{lastly-its-time-to-write-the-text}}

And once you have the fleshed out outline, it's time to start writing your first draft. Remember that the best way to start writing is to do just that. It's unlikely that your first effort will be the one that you will finally submit. But start writing. Then read, go back and polish. And keep polishing until you achieve your goal.

\hypertarget{goodenough}{%
\section{When is it good enough to submit to my advisor?}\label{goodenough}}

Once you've read and revised the draft text three times yourself, and you feel that you can't really improve it any more, hand it over. Personally, I need to wait a day or more between drafts when I work on something else, or do some reading. I find that it really helps to think about writing while not writing. Run through the arguments in your head when you are doing something else. That could be time in the gym, out running, cycling or swimming. Or talk through the logic of your argument with a friend or colleague while having coffee. You'll find that spending time thinking away from sitting in front of your word-processor will be really valuable in promoting productivity once you sit down again.

If possible, hand it to an office mate or other friend first. Your reader shouldn't have to be an expert in your field, but only needs to have a loose grasp on scientific writing to follow any paper. As a guide, any recent graduate of a biological sciences degree (BSc) should be able to understand. This makes it easy to find lots of potential readers for your manuscript before handing it in.

\textbf{In summary}

Writing a paper as a formula is not the only way of writing a scientific manuscript, but it has two really important qualities which I recommend:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  it makes writing easier, and
\item
  readers will be familiar with the style and this will help them understand your work.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{data}{%
\section{Data Management}\label{data}}

Almost everyone has had the experience of having written some really excellent work, and then had some terrible technology malfunction meaning that they lose everything. Some failure to backup stories are truly horrific. However, they all represent a failure on the part of the person involved to properly backup their work.

At the time of writing, it is very easy to keep copies of documents on the cloud, or even write straight onto the cloud. Talk to your advisor about what options are available in your institution for backing up your work. Make a plan early on, before you start with your study, and then stick with that backup plan as you move through your PhD. A really good option is to start working in one of the Open Science platforms. For example, OSF allows you to create a project where you can continue to use lots of different cloud based resources, and provides an integrated home for them (for an introductory video see here). OSF is also a great platform as it is free to use, and as long as individual files are less than 5 Gb, OSF will host them. This means that for most projects, raw data files can be stored on the cloud at no cost to the project.

\hypertarget{should-the-cloud-be-the-only-copy-of-your-data}{%
\subsection{Should the cloud be the only copy of your data?}\label{should-the-cloud-be-the-only-copy-of-your-data}}

No.~I suggest that you keep a hard drive with a copy of your data that you regularly deposit on a monthly basis, or after significant bouts of data collection such as field trips or experiments. A hard drive has the advantage that in the case of an internet outage, you always have access to your data.

Don't try to store data on a laptop or desktop computer. These are for working files only. Backup is a separate operation where you store files. While computers are good for computation, they are frail and much more likely to suffer from catastrophic failures. They are also objects that are prone to being stolen.

\hypertarget{backing-up-in-the-field}{%
\subsection{Backing up in the field}\label{backing-up-in-the-field}}

If you are going to be doing lots of field work, then you might want to make a specific plan about backing up data to the cloud during the field time. It may seem expensive, but I'm sure that it won't be as expensive as losing the data. Alternatively, or in addition, you may want to take a portable storage option.

I still prefer field notes and data to be written into a book (preferably with waterproof paper such as \href{https://www.riteintherain.com/}{rite in the rain}). This allows you to make a photographic backup of the hard copy. Similarly, you can design datasheets that you use in the field with a pencil, and then photograph them to make a hard copy. I don't like entering data directly into a laptop or other device. For me, the advantage is that it is too easy to mis-type a data point into a device, and then there is no record about what it should have been. These days there are multiple different ways to enter data into devices (including dictation), and so you should make your own plan about what you feel most comfortable with. If you do make a hard copy, you will then have to transcribe it later. If you make mistakes, you can go back to the hard copy.

\hypertarget{make-a-data-management-plan-and-stick-to-it}{%
\subsection{Make a data management plan, and stick to it}\label{make-a-data-management-plan-and-stick-to-it}}

However you decide to manage your data, make sure that you have a plan and that you stick to it. Don't become a victim of some unexpected event that will lose your data. These events will still happen, but at least your existing data will be safe. Creating a secure data management plan (Figure \ref{fig:Data-management}) is something that you should design and then talk through with your advisor. There is much more to data management than simply backing up your data. A great start is to read through the \href{https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/BES-Guide-Data-Management-2019.pdf}{British Ecological Society's guide to Data Management}. \href{SuppInfo.html}{See part 3} for information about how to archive and distribute your data.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/Data-management} \caption{\textbf{The data management cycle.} It is possible to see your data as a cycle between creation and distribution. Your plan should aim to cover each of these steps (redrawn from the British Ecological Society's guide to Data Management).}\label{fig:Data-management}
\end{figure}

You probably won't be able to think about all the potential pitfalls that may happen during your PhD, but if there are some obvious ones, then do consider them and see whether you can mitigate the circumstances should they occur.

\hypertarget{part3}{%
\chapter{Writing the sections that make up your chapter}\label{part3}}

Getting over the cognitive inertia of starting to write is top of the list for most of us. The approach provided here is to present you with a formula that breaks down each section into smaller more reasonably sized chunks. However, you still need to make a start. Procrastinating starting to write is normal. It seems a massive task, even if you've done it lots of times before. You want to write the best manuscript that you can, but you aren't feeling on top form today, so doesn't it seem a better idea to wait until tomorrow? It's not. You must start today and start now. Don't set the bar so high for your first draft. In fact, don't set any bar other than a personal goal of getting the first draft done.

For the first draft, type away confident in the knowledge that 90\% of the first draft will get junked or changed so much that you won't recognise it. That's ok, and it's not a waste of your time. In fact, the first draft is invaluable in getting your ideas and perspective down on paper, allowing you to better organise and sift through your thoughts to bring clarity to your manuscript. Allow yourself a reward for finishing your first draft, something that you won't do until it's done. Now make life easy for yourself by changing the order of what you write.

Although I have placed the contents of this chapter as you'd expect to see them in a typical paper, this is not the order I would suggest that you write them in. The most important part of writing up your chapter or paper is to have your hypothesis or question clearly stated. Once you have this, it will help you to know the literature that is already there and so writing the introduction next seems logical. Of course, you may already have \href{proposal.html}{your proposal} to work with, in which case you can start by reviewing what you already have and deciding whether or not you need to tweak this, or if you need a fresh start.

The methods and materials are the easiest section to write first, especially if you've already done the practical work. This section will also help you focus on the analysis that you are doing for the results. Again you should review your proposal and see whether there were any significant changes to your planned methodology and note them down. This will not be an issue even if you have \href{transparency.html}{preregistered your proposal}, you simply need to provide a rational explanation for why things changed.

Next write the results. Remember that you are only looking to respond to your hypotheses, preferably using your (preregistered) proposal plans. Tables and figures are compiled along with the results. Now you have the materials and methods together with the results in full. I suggest that you make a list of all the relevant discussion points you want to make and then turn your attention to the introduction. Begin with an outline, before you flesh it out.

Lastly, write the abstract. Populate your article with references as you write. While you can leave the formatting of references until the end, it's dangerous to not put citations in as you write as you are likely to forget which paper is which by the end.

\hypertarget{title}{%
\section{Title page}\label{title}}

Most of the following information in this section on the title pertain to getting a manuscript ready for submission to a journal. For your thesis, I would recommend that you have a title page for each chapter that lists any collaborators and their contributions so that this is transparent for the examiners. It also helps break up the document and can be a good spot for a non-academic illustration (if your institution permits).

Nearly all journals will require you to have a title page for your manuscript. This may or may not include authors. Check to see whether the journal that you are submitting to conducts double-blind review. If they do, they will require a title page without any indication of authors or institutions (they will also likely ask you to remove the acknowledgements section). This should be clearly specified in the instructions to authors of your chosen journal.

\hypertarget{ORCID}{%
\subsection{Names and addresses are important}\label{ORCID}}

Getting authors' names correct, their correct addresses (many people have more than one affiliation), can be tricky. Check that you have all of the information required of a title page before you submit. While you need the names of your co-authors to be displayed correctly, you do not need their titles (no Dr.~or Prof., etc.).

Indicate clearly who is the corresponding author. Normally, if you have done all of the rest of the work, the corresponding author should be you. You need to learn how to start this role at some point, so it might as well be now. Having the correct name and address will be important to each author. Along with the author names and addresses you should record the ORCID \href{ORCID.html}{see part 3} of each author. The ORCID is simply a unique identification code for individual researchers. ORCID is a non-profit organisation and there's nothing sinister in signing up. If they (or you) don't have one, then you should ask them to create one before the submission. It takes less than 5 minutes. Go to www.orcid.org

Note that the same information given in the title page will also be needed when you enter the information into the journal submission site.

Work closely with your advisor, and make sure that your co-authors are aware of the correspondence that arrives from the journal. Use an address for correspondence that you know you check regularly. It;s also worth checking the spam of your email regularly so that you catch any correspondence that might have been misclassified. The golden rule for the corresponding author is the timely communication with the other authors when decisions have to be made.

\hypertarget{the-title}{%
\subsection{The Title}\label{the-title}}

The title of your paper, chapter or book is the first thing that any reader will read, and so should be well considered. If your reader cannot quickly understand your title, the chances are that they won't bother reading any further. Your title will be your selling point, and your aim is to use it to draw your readership in. Once you've managed to invegle your readers to download your paper, your title is also their hook for remembering your paper in their database of thousands of others. Having their key word in your title will help here, and as ever with writing your challenge is to think like your reader. The best titles are those that sum up the entire study in five to seven words. This is best done in a narrative that tells the story (\href{storytelling.html}{see part 2}) of your manuscript in its entirety. This may sound daunting, but you should get into the habit of summing up your story quickly (for friends, relatives and work colleagues). Then it's a question of refining this story into the short single sentence that makes up the title. While the narrative approach may not work for you, you do want the title to provide enough information so that the potential reader knows what they will find before they open it. Your title doesn't just have to work for you, it needs to work for a wide audience.

Some people are excellent at writing titles that contain puns of well known phrases or sayings. These can be brilliant, working both to inform what's in the paper as well as providing some familiar input that helps retain them in memory. However, many fail to do either and are simply a waste of space. If you are tempted to use a pun as your title, make sure that it is widely appreciated, and not just among your co-authors and lab.

You don't have to come up with a killer title from day one. Most of my manuscripts have a working title that gets revised as I write, and is always open for change before submission. If you have great ideas for a title, do note them down. I find that the more options I have, the more likely I am to come up with something that works for everyone. It also helps to mix and match from a set of candidate titles. Once you have come up with something that looks good to you and your colleagues, test it by entering it into your database of choice (with the default being Google Scholar - see Part 2). Your first 10 results should include a set of papers that you have likely cited in the upper area of your introduction. If you don't recognise any out of the top 10, it's time to look at another of your candidate titles.

\hypertarget{key-words}{%
\subsection{Key Words}\label{key-words}}

The key words are a way for readers to find your content with searches. Typically, the advice is to use words that are not in the title or abstract. This is because many databases have combined searching facilities for title, abstract and key words. I struggle to think of appropriate key words. Some of the big idea words and short phrases from the introduction. Then I tend to look at articles in the same genre, and see what key words they have used. As with the title, I suggest that you enter your chosen key words into your literature database of choice \href{database.html}{see part 2} and see what comes back. You should see a group of papers that look wholly familiar and preferably those that are already cited in your manuscript. If not, it's time to look again.

\hypertarget{abstract}{%
\section{The Abstract}\label{abstract}}

A good abstract is very important as, like a good title, it advertises the content of the paper and draws readers in. In a world where the quantity of scientific literature is increasing, it is more likely that someone will read your abstract but not your paper. Actually, it's far more likely that someone will read your title and use that to decide whether or not to look at the abstract. Moreover, when you submit your work to the journal, your editor may decide whether or not to immediately reject your manuscript based on the content of the abstract. Therefore, it had better be good!

\hypertarget{what-is-the-abstract}{%
\subsection{What is the abstract?}\label{what-is-the-abstract}}

The abstract is a concise paragraph that sums up the major points of your manuscript so that the potential reader will be able to assess whether or not they want to read the entire paper. It is an abstract of the entire document. It should not be abstract!

\hypertarget{so-what-would-a-good-abstract-contain}{%
\subsection{So what would a good abstract contain?}\label{so-what-would-a-good-abstract-contain}}

A good abstract is a summary of the highlights of the paper. You can't hope to include all of the results, but you should include sample sizes, variables and relevant statistics when they support your major hypotheses. You must include the broader subject area that your study fits into, and show how your results are relevant to this.

None of this is easy, and you should not expect to write your abstract in a single sitting. It will likely require multiple iterations, and some intense word-smithing to make it as good as it can be. Abstracts almost always have a word limit, and that makes it challenging and means that you have to be concise \href{concise.html}{see part 2}.

Increasingly, you'll hear that a good abstract is citable. This means that it contains enough information that someone knows that it can be used to cite for a specific fact. Of course, these people should download and read the entire study, but there is no guarentee that they will.

\hypertarget{where-do-you-start}{%
\subsection{Where do you start?}\label{where-do-you-start}}

Just like planning your writing in general, I'd suggest starting your abstract with an outline. Use bullet points to make a list of things that you feel that you should include. Rearrange your list until you have all the introduction points at the start, results in the middle and discussion at the end.

There's no need for detailed methodology, but it is useful to know the approach. For example, `we used a common garden experimental approach' or `we sampled 85 animals from three invasive populations'.
Although many abstracts are provided as a single paragraph, some are structured into the sections of the paper, or as numbered points. Using this formula is a good way to get disciplined about boiling your paper down into a small amount of concise words. It's worth keeping a copy of any abstract that you compose like this in case you decide to submit to a journal that requires it.

Starting with this framework will ensure that the abstract is well balanced.

At this point, I'd circulate it to your advisor to ask whether there are other key points that should be included. As a rule, it's easier to start with everything present, and only then cut the words down to something within the abstract word limit. If you wordsmith your abstract and then try and add a key point later, it'll never come out so well.

\hypertarget{when-do-you-write-your-abstract}{%
\subsection{When do you write your abstract?}\label{when-do-you-write-your-abstract}}

Although the abstract comes on page 1 of your manuscript, only try to write it once you've got to the end of the process of writing your manuscript so that you are aware of all the major points that you need to include. Maybe once you've \href{goodenough.html}{submitted your second draft} of the manuscript to your advisor (given that you are both happy with the content), you can formulate the abstract.

\hypertarget{do-abstracts-for-conferences-differ}{%
\subsection{Do abstracts for conferences differ?}\label{do-abstracts-for-conferences-differ}}

Yes. It's likely that an abstract for a talk will not be the same, unless you have already published the study: but even then it's probably worth re-writing it. I'd suggest that your conference abstract be more descriptive and thought provoking, such that it is aimed toward the specific audience of the conference. Pose questions that you will answer in your talk.

\hypertarget{where-do-people-go-wrong-in-writing-the-abstract}{%
\subsection{Where do people go wrong in writing the abstract?}\label{where-do-people-go-wrong-in-writing-the-abstract}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The most common mistake is getting the balance wrong. I often see an abstract that gets to the results, runs out of space and simply stops. It is important to have a statement about your interpretation of the results which relates back to your hypothesis.
\item
  Another common mistake is to have a very simply worded abstract that conveys very little information. There is definitely going to be a lot to put in, so expect to write something too long with too much content, and then cut it down by discussing with your advisor what can be left out.
\item
  Text from the main document is copied into the abstract. I've written about this \href{plagiarism.html}{elsewhere}, but you should never copy parts of your writing. You could start like this, but wordsmithing must change the words and their order substantially. Otherwise, when the first sentence of the abstract is the same as the first sentence of the manuscript, it will really turn off your readers.
\item
  Too many statistics or no numbers are also common mistakes. Adding numbers and statistics are important, especially when they take the place of more words.
\item
  There is only time for one or two comments on the discussion, so pick out something important. Look through your written discussion and rank the points that you make in terms of interest to others. Can you combine two or more points into a single sentence?
\item
  The introduction of the abstract must frame the bigger question, and the discussion must show how your data responds to this.
\item
  Don't be tempted to overreach with your claims in the abstract (or the main text). Include major caveats when they are relevant.
\item
  Finish with something conclusive and strong, preferably how this study changes the understanding, and not a caveat or suggested further study.
\item
  The abstract does not contain citations (or very rarely and only if unavoidable), so don't put any in!

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If you have to have a citation in your abstract, then it must include sufficient information that it can be found without opening up the paper: \emph{first author, abbreviated journal name, volume, first page}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{The Introduction}\label{introduction}}

\hypertarget{why-do-we-need-an-introduction}{%
\subsection{Why do we need an introduction?}\label{why-do-we-need-an-introduction}}

The introduction and discussion appear to be two common stumbling points for students writing chapters or manuscripts. First, what to put in and what to leave out. And second how to construct it. They are complimentary, and if written well can be read without the Materials and Methods or Results, with the reader still gaining all of the major information of the manuscript.

The introduction is going to be the first part of your manuscript that anyone reads. Yes, they've already taken in the title and the abstract. These are almost like bait to draw readers in. The meat starts with the introduction. And it's not only important to get all the correct content in there, it's also important not to give misleading information that might distract the reader.

When you write the introduction to a paper you must not be tempted to stray away from what we are aiming to introduce. The aim of our introduction is to explain to the reader the hypothesis you are testing, and the approach you have taken to test it.

\hypertarget{so-what-do-we-put-into-the-introduction}{%
\subsection{So what do we put into the introduction?}\label{so-what-do-we-put-into-the-introduction}}

As I've said elsewhere, the \href{hypothesis.html}{hypothesis} itself is made up of different parts, and each of these must be explained in the introduction. We also need to understand the approach that you've decided to take in your study (e.g.~experimental, lab or field approach, observations or natural history). All of these decisions that you made were informed by the literature, as is your general understanding of the subject that you are studying. So making sure that you cite (\href{citations.html}{read about citing}) the relevant literature is a key ingredient of the introduction.

However, this is where I think many people get side tracked. Researchers love reading, and it's super easy to get sucked into all the amazing things that people have done in an ever expanding and increasingly interesting literature. We are often tempted to show exactly how well read we are. Or put in that fascinating tit-bit that we stumbled on by accident. However, you must keep focussed on the goal, to introduce the hypothesis to the reader, and try not to allow yourself (and consequently your reader) to get distracted.

Consider this analogy: You can think of the introduction as being a highway to your hypothesis. As you drive the highway, it's fine to see signposts that lead to other places, but don't be tempted to turn off the highway to visit them. You do need to take your reader to your question as efficiently as you can. Point out the relevant sites on the way, but don't stop until you get where you're going.

\hypertarget{and-the-construction}{%
\subsection{And the construction\ldots?}\label{and-the-construction}}

Previously, I've described the introduction like a funnel (Figure \ref{fig:introduction}), where we channel the reader into our hypothesis by starting broad and ending up narrow (\href{formula.html}{see the formula}). This can draw criticism that journal articles are expected to fit a certain style, that this style is boring, and that what we really need is for people to write in a more exciting and varied way. Although I do not disagree with this, my objective here, is to try to demystify writing and enable you to get started. The easiest way to get started is, I believe, through a formula. But it is important to say that the funnel isn't the only way, and I've read some great papers where the first sentence of the introduction is the hypothesis. However you do it, the hypothesis is at the heart of your introduction because it is the reason for your work.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/introduction} \caption{\textbf{The introduction funnel.} My suggestion is to keep to the funnel if you want to make life easier for yourself. Start by writing an outline of where you want your text to go. Then add in the references that are pertinent to each paragraph of the outline. Make sure that there aren't any paragraphs with a single citation repeated over and again; it's more likely that there is a lot more relevant information out there.}\label{fig:introduction}
\end{figure}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 2\tabcolsep) * \real{0.47}}

\caption{\label{tab:introparagraphs} \textbf{Here is a guide to the contents of each paragraph of your introduction.} Although you should not feel constrained by this suggestion, it might help you get started when planning your bullet pointed structure of the introduction before you start writing.}\tabularnewline

Paragraph 4 & Introduce the approach that you are using, and the organism of choice. \\
Paragraph 5 & Clearly state the hypotheses that are to be tested. \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Note that you can shuffle your paragraphs in Table \ref{tab:introparagraphs} to the point where it still makes sense to the reader. Don't be overly strict or dogmatic with this (or any) advice. For example, there may be more than 5 paragraphs, but use the framework to get started. Do what works for you in your situation. But beware of making any introduction too long.

Now that you've fleshed out your outline with relevant citations, it'll be time to pass it by your advisor to check that you are moving in the right direction before you start writing. My suggestion is always to use your advisor to get the advice that you need -- that's what they're there for!

Remember that while this section on writing the introduction is short, much of \href{part2.html}{Part II} concerns writing style that is applicable to your introduction. In particular, sections on composing your \href{hypothesis.html}{hypothesis}, writing a \href{paragraph.html}{paragraph}, and an \href{argument.html}{argument} should be referred to when you are writing your introduction.

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\section{The Materials and Methods}\label{methods}}

You should start writing this section in your proposal, and you may have to alter parts of it when turning it into your thesis later (if you change your methods). For most people, it's a relatively simple exercise, but here are some pointers to get you started.

The Materials and Methods section should be citation dense, especially if you have used standard methods that have been written up elsewhere. If there are different methods, you should also explain why you used one over the other, as reviewers or examiners may require this.

If you are introducing new methodologies, then you can expect to write a lot in this section about exactly how this was done, as well as the background to the reasons why the new approach to the methodology was taken.

Your aim is to produce a coherent methodology that anyone in the next 200 years (or more) can pick up and follow in order to replicate your study.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/methods} \caption{\textbf{There's nothing to writing the methods except remaining methodical.} Your methods are likely to have some generic aspects to other study types in your field of biological sciences.}\label{fig:methods}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{sections-or-subheadings}{%
\subsection{Sections or subheadings}\label{sections-or-subheadings}}

As ever, I'm going to recommend inserting section headers into your Materials and Methods to help you break it up into bite sized chunks. These are principally for the reader, but will also make your job easier.

An important point here is to make sure that you keep your variables (what you are measuring to test your question) out of the sections like study organism and animal husbandry. Don't be tempted to scatter variables and how you measured them throughout the Materials and Methods section. Keep them clear and maintain a logical flow, using a time-line if that makes sense.

\hypertarget{study-organism-or-study-system}{%
\subsection{Study organism or study system}\label{study-organism-or-study-system}}

Having already written the \href{introduction.html}{introduction}, you will know that there isn't too much space to write a lot of information about your study organism there. However, often there is important background information that is needed on the species, which would be distracting or lose the flow of the \href{introduction.html}{introduction}. By having a `Study Organism' section at the start of your Materials and Methods, you can add in all relevant information in a paragraph or two.

For example, if you are working on African clawed frogs, \emph{Xenopus laevis}, as a model organism you will want to use this space to describe why they are a good system for this particular investigation. Alternatively, your study could be detailing their invasion biology, in which case this would be the section where you can explain their distribution, that they are principally aquatic, or that they are invasive on four continents. You probably won't need all of these points, but just the aspects of this species' biology that is relevant to your study. You should make sure you know whether or not the journal requires the taxonomic authority. If you are not sure, include it now (\href{taxonomy.html}{see here for an explanation}).

Similarly, if you are working on invasive zebra fish, \emph{Danio rerio}, you can write in this section the known dates when they were introduced to Japan, and how we know that those animals came from. You can also give details of their natural range in South Asia.

If you are working on a community of animals, or it is the geographical region that is more important than any single species, you should explain the study system here. For example, if your study is about the rainforest, then you should provide some background information about this kind of vegetation here.

If relevant, you may need to provide a map with the location of samples that you used in this section. My preference is to try to provide a composite figure that will also include an image of your study organism (if relevant).

\hypertarget{animal-husbandry-growing-conditions-culturing-techniques}{%
\subsection{Animal husbandry / Growing Conditions / Culturing Techniques}\label{animal-husbandry-growing-conditions-culturing-techniques}}

If you have kept animals in the lab, grown plants or cultured bacteria in order to do your experiments, then you need to provide details of how you did this. For plants this will include all relevant information on their source, propogation, growth medium and climatic regimes. For animals, you need to include their source, welfare, housing, feeding, light:dark cycles, temperature, etc. If you bred animals to produce your study life-history stage, all relevant information is needed here. All this information should be available from your ethics application. Some journals will want you to include the details of your ethics permission here.

\hypertarget{repetitive-methodology}{%
\subsection{Repetitive methodology}\label{repetitive-methodology}}

If you've used the same methodology for each part of your data collection (like DNA extraction, sequencing, etc.), you should have a section that explains all of this prior to any experimental manipulations done. I would suggest that this is detailed in the first relevant chapter of your thesis, and then referred to in later chapters. It's best to go to look to see what other people have reported on in order to know what level of detail to include. For example, 20 years ago it would have been important to include detailed information of how you extracted DNA from tissues. Today, you can probably say that you used a standard extraction kit or salt extraction without saying more.

\hypertarget{do-you-need-to-include-formulae}{%
\subsection{Do you need to include formulae?}\label{do-you-need-to-include-formulae}}

Some of your methodologies will include calculations that rest on mathematical formula which can be written in mathematical notation. Certainly, there are plenty of examples in the biological sciences, especially in modelling, where these formulas are needed because they are developed within the methodology in order to produce the \href{results.html}{results}. If your thesis involves this type of mathematical progression, then you will already know this is expected because all of the literature that you read will contain equations and formulas. However, if you are calculating (for example) the surface areas of a leaf, through a set of measurements, do you need to provide the formula you used in your materials and methods?

I would move ahead on the premise that formulas that are well established in the literature need only be referenced, and not quoted. If you are building on any formula with new variables introduced by you in your study for the first time, then you will need to show the progression of these formulas. Remember that equations, formulas and theorems are all numbered in the text in a way that you can make reference to them later.

\hypertarget{experimental-manipulations-and-data-collection}{%
\subsection{Experimental manipulations and data collection}\label{experimental-manipulations-and-data-collection}}

If you have done more than one kind of experiment, it's probably a good idea to give each a separate subheading. Be consistent with these subheadings between the Materials and Methods and the \href{results.html}{results}.

One very important point here is to fully explain the collection of all of the variables that are used in your analyses. Remember to use exactly the same names for your variables here, as you have in the \href{introduction.html}{introduction} (and will use in your \href{figures.html}{figures} and \href{results.html}{results} sections). It's very important that the reader gets this consistency across sections. Please also remember to include all units that you collect data in (there is a space between numbers and units!), and the accuracy of the measuring equipment used.

Your variables may be sufficiently complicated that you need to add extra subsections in order to accommodate and explain them properly. This is fine. It's also a good idea to use a table to explain a complicated sampling regime, or even a flow diagram. If you find yourself having trouble getting all of the information across in words, then go back to drawing a diagram that explains your data collection and ask around to see whether others find this an easier way to understand your setup. Diagrams and/or tables are there to replace words, so once you've decided which you want to include, you can delete the rest.

\hypertarget{equipment}{%
\subsubsection{Equipment}\label{equipment}}

Many journals require that you name the company that you bought equipment from as well as the town and country where it was made. This is to help others that might want to buy the same equipment (although it's a bit outdated in these days of multinational companies). You should try to get all of the model numbers of equipment as you do the work, so that you are not scrambling later on to find out what they were. It's really quick and easy to take a picture of this at the time.

If you have built or designed new equipment for your Materials and Methods, you can expect to make a diagram of this here, if it can't be adequately described in a paragraph.

\hypertarget{data-analysis}{%
\subsection{Data analysis}\label{data-analysis}}

This section is getting increasingly longer as people do ever more fancy statistical manipulations. As above, it's very important that you use the same names for the variables as you have introduced and collected them. In addition to explaining the specific tests that you performed, you should explain what roles the variables have as dependent, independent, or random variables in your model.

\textbf{The independent variable} has variation that does not depend on that of any other measure. These are usually measured by you during the experiment.

\textbf{The dependent variable} is usually the one that you are testing to see whether any of the independent variables explain it.

\textbf{Random variables} are subject to variations outside of your experimental control but that you want to make sure do not influence your interpretation of the dependent variable. Examples of random variables might be the order in which you did the experiment, or the position in your experimental setup).

You should be familiar with the terms above from when you formulated your hypothesis (see \href{hypothesis.html}{Part II} for a refresher).

Any transformation of any of the data that you collected (e.g.~log, ln, cosine) should be mentioned here, along with tests that you performed to ensure that they adhere to the conditions required for the statistical test that you conducted.

Give the name for each package in R that you use, together with its citation. Some journals will have particular software conventions that you need to respect and adhere to. Also give a citation to R as well as the version that you used in your analysis. If you don't use the latest version of R, then your reviewers may want to know why, so always remember to update your version of R when you do your analysis.

\hypertarget{did-you-leave-anything-out}{%
\subsection{Did you leave anything out?}\label{did-you-leave-anything-out}}

By following your Materials and Methods, anyone else should be able to repeat your work. If there isn't enough detail for someone else to conduct the same experiment or survey, then you will need to add this information somewhere. For example, a list of sampling points or a database of sequences might be needed in Supplementary Information.

The Materials and Methods section can often get overly long, and is relatively easy to edit to make it much shorter. In journals where there is a word count limit, you may want to move some of the Materials and Methods into a supplementation information section. But in your thesis, try to keep the Materials and Methods section as detailed as you can.

\hypertarget{results}{%
\section{The Results}\label{results}}

This is perhaps the easiest section of your chapter or manuscript to write. However, there are still many mistakes that are made. Let's start with the approach that you should take, and then go through some of the common mistakes.

\hypertarget{the-correct-approach---responding-to-your-hypotheses}{%
\subsection{The correct approach - responding to your hypotheses}\label{the-correct-approach---responding-to-your-hypotheses}}

Yes, the easiest way to write the results is simply to have the questions or hypotheses that you posed at the end of the introduction and have them as subheadings for your results section. Once you have these subheadings, you simply assemble all of the results with respect to that hypothesis. You should already have all the tests that you used in the methods section.

The results section often includes a lot of statistical testing, resulting in lots of numbers inside brackets within the text. This is all expected and fine, but consider consolidating multiple iterations into a table (if appropriate). And if your tests are already in a table, then they should not be repeated in your text. Instead, simply make your statement asserting the results and add ``(see Table 1)''.

When describing the relationship between two variables, make sure that you state the direction of the effect. This means not simply stating that they have a significant relationship, but what that relationship is. This means stating that one increases with the other (a direct relationship) or one increases when the other decreases (an inverse relationship). Once you have described the result, either make reference to the Table or Figure where this can be seen, or describe the results of the test in brackets.

If you do have to insert the results of a statistical test into the text, include the test statistic, degrees of freedom (which incorporates N - the sample size) and the value of P. Only if P is less than alpha (usually 0.05) can you use the word `significant' when describing the effect.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/results} \caption{\textbf{You may well find that your results section is the shortest section of your manuscript.} Only report what you need to in this section. Keep results that don't respond to your hypotheses for the Supplementary Information.}\label{fig:results}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{when-to-have-a-table-or-graph}{%
\subsection{When to have a table or graph?}\label{when-to-have-a-table-or-graph}}

Most journals will allow you to have as many tables or graphs as you need to give your results. There are a few important things to consider. First, that data shouldn't be repeated. So don't have a table of results where the same results are also in a graph (or even two graphs that show the same data). Also, don't repeat data from a figure or table in your text. You need to decide how best to present your data. If you can't decide then discuss it with your advisor by presenting them with the alternatives. Good results should convey your findings clearly, and consulting with others should quickly help you decide which approach is effective.

See sections on \href{tables.html}{tables} and \href{figures.html}{figures} below.

\hypertarget{descriptive-results}{%
\subsection{Descriptive results}\label{descriptive-results}}

Some studies have a set of descriptive results that, by convention, are placed without a section header at the start of the results. These normally convey the size of the dataset that entered into the rest of the analyses. If the size of the dataset varies by design in the methods, then you don't need it here. But you can't always control the sample size, so it needs to be established before moving on to the rest of the results. In genetic studies, for example, this might include the number of samples that were collected and successfully sequenced, and thus entered into the rest of the analyses. Your text can then be broken into sections that correspond with your questions, unless you only have one in which case further sections are not warranted.

\hypertarget{responding-to-hypotheses}{%
\subsection{Responding to hypotheses}\label{responding-to-hypotheses}}

While I encourage you to present data that corresponds to hypotheses here in the results section, you should not formally accept or reject your hypothesis here. This is done in the discussion, and allows you to present caveats and other important issues.

\hypertarget{common-mistakes}{%
\subsection{Common Mistakes}\label{common-mistakes}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Having extra analyses in the results that you didn't include in your methods. If you really didn't anticipate conducting the extra tests, then these are actually \emph{post hoc} (after the event) tests (not anticipated before the study) and you should think carefully about how to treat these. Otherwise, you'll need to r-ejig your methods to make sure that all tests are included.
\item
  Meaningless precision. This can happen throughout a thesis or manuscript (e.g.~in the Materials and Methods), but it is most common in the results when too many significant figures are reported. For example, the output of your analysis might tell you that flight feathers in one population are 2.6484332 mm longer than those of another (± 0.0654562 mm), but in your methods you only use callipers that have a precision of 0.01 mm. Reporting results beyond the precision whereby they can be measured quickly becomes meaningless. Whenever you obtain the output of a statistical package, you need to make sure that you use your practical head to re-interpret these results and think about what they actually mean.
\item
  Repeating numbers in the text that are already in tables or graphs. The text is likely to be packed with numbers already, so don't repeat any that are already represented elsewhere.
\item
  Repeating text in different sections. As you've seen elsewhere in this book, repeating text simply isn't acceptable. It doesn't matter if you did the same thing many times, you can always write something in a different way. Having repeated text is the fastest way to bore the pants off your reader, and therefore must be avoided at all costs.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{The Discussion}\label{discussion}}

The discussion should be the final section of your manuscript or chapter that you are going to write (given that the \href{abstract.html}{abstract} will come last). This is because for the discussion you must already know all of the rest of the manuscript, starting with the hypothesis, which dictates what will go into all of the other sections. While writing the other sections, I often make notes under the heading `discussion' so that it acts as an \emph{aide memoire} to ideas that I've had during the study.

Before you start writing your discussion, make a plan and then discuss this plan with your advisor. I'd make this suggestion for all of the sections of your chapter or paper. It doesn't take that long to do, and it provides an opportunity for you and your advisor to talk about the \href{results.html}{results} of your work and discuss them together. Such discussions should be eye opening for both of you, and they provide a great opportunity for you and your advisor to get excited about the work you've done, your \href{results.html}{results} and what they mean. I get a lot of enjoyment during these discussions, especially when sharing the excitement of the \href{results.html}{results}. Sharing thoughts before you start writing is important because by talking about it, you and your advisor are more likely to come to a consensus about the best way in which to interpret your \href{results.html}{results}. Conversely, presenting them with the discussion finished might not be the best way of pitching ideas to them. Once you've had time to discuss it, you might have a lot more work to do in rewriting what you've already produced.

There is a convention that you do not refer to the \href{tables.html}{tables} or \href{figures.html}{figures} in the discussion. This is because they have already been referred to in the \href{results.html}{results}, and a reader should have already consulted them there. Occasionally, you may want to have a new conceptual diagram in the discussion, but this is rare. Most often you do not refer to figures or tables and no new ones appear in the discussion.

In general, the first and last paragraphs of the discussion are key to the reader, but the discussion must also consider caveats and limitations in the experimental design and interpretation of your \href{results.html}{results}, as well as providing a concise discussion of the results in the context of existing literature. This is also your opportunity to suggest new hypotheses and how they could be tested.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/discussion} \caption{\textbf{Your discussion needs structure too.} Let's remember that if you are struggling to write, there is the potential to follow a formula, such as the one I outlined previously.}\label{fig:discussion}
\end{figure}

Again, I'd like to repeat that the convention described above is a formula that is intended to help you getting started with writing. It is not the only way to write, and if you feel confident that another way is better then I encourage you to explore this with the support of your advisor. Be imaginative and don't feel that you are constrained or compelled to do anything in a formulaic way.

\hypertarget{first-paragraph-of-the-discussion}{%
\subsection{First paragraph of the discussion}\label{first-paragraph-of-the-discussion}}

Your discussion begins by you responding to your hypothesis, clearly stating whether or not it has been accepted, and putting this into the wider context of the study (i.e.~paragraph one or two of the \href{introduction.html}{introduction} with relevant literature). You can then follow these statements by emphasising what you consider to be the most important finding, and explain how it adds to existing literature. However, don't be tempted to over-interpret your results, or claim that they mean more than they do (\href{speculation.html}{see section on speculation} below).

This first paragraph of the discussion doesn't have to be very long (three to four sentences), but you should make sure that you end by providing a link to the following paragraph or explaining how you will move the discussion on in sections.

\hypertarget{to-sub-section-or-not-to-sub-section-the-discussion}{%
\subsection{To sub-section or not to sub-section the discussion?}\label{to-sub-section-or-not-to-sub-section-the-discussion}}

My preference is to plan the discussion before you write it, just as you did for the \href{introduction.html}{introduction} using a bullet pointed list. This will provide you with logical sub-section headers for the discussion under which you can write the first draft. When your chapter has a simple aim that is easily communicated, I'd suggest deleting these sub-section headings before you finish. However, many studies are more complex and contain multiple experiments or evidential approaches. It is then sometimes wise to leave sub-sections in your discussion so that your reader can more easily follow the text. Where possible, these should be the same sub-sections that you have broken your \href{methods.html}{methods} and \href{results.html}{results} into, especially where these relate to specific hypotheses or aims. Or it may be more appropriate to discuss the different approaches separately, specifically when the literature that you refer to falls into different groups.

If you are stuck and can't decide which way is most appropriate for your work, spend more time on fleshing the outline specifically to include the literature that you want to cite. Try it one way, and then the other, and you should quickly be able to tell which makes more sense. Of course, you should also ask your advisor for their opinion -- that's what they are there for, after all.

When considering what sub-section to write first, go back to the order that you've presented the questions or approaches in the rest of your chapter or manuscript. Keeping the order consistent throughout is a really good way of helping your reader follow what you want to communicate. Shuffling the order in each section is almost guaranteed to get them lost and wishing that they hadn't started reading.

\textbf{Next you need to discuss!}

The discussion is about explaining the meaning of your \href{results.html}{results} to the reader. I often find that people write a lot of inappropriate information in the discussion. Remember that this section is not going to provide background information, and is unlikely to bring up new topics that need introducing. It may be that your \href{results.html}{results} prompt you to introduce a new area of research that wasn't covered in your \href{introduction.html}{introduction}, and this is fine. But for the main part, you should discuss your \href{results.html}{results} in the context of existing literature. You can expect that the literature that you use in your discussion will only partially overlap with your \href{introduction.html}{introduction}, with plenty of new citations. Similarly, it can be that discussing your \href{results.html}{results} will mean that you end up with paragraphs that have no citations.

When providing different sides of an \href{argument.html}{argument}, try to use your \href{results.html}{results} to conclude that one side is supported more than the other. If your results don't help with this particular point, then it could be that you are trying to discuss something that isn't directly related to the work. This is a very common problem in discussions, and a good test is asking yourself how your \href{results.html}{results} add to the point you are trying to discuss. If they don't leave it out and move on.

\hypertarget{caveats-and-limitations}{%
\subsection{Caveats and limitations}\label{caveats-and-limitations}}

An important aspect of the discussion is to consider how the interpretation of your \href{results.html}{results} may be incorrect. For example, if you have done an experiment, how well controlled was it and how well could it be considered to scale up to real world interactions? Could you have measured other variables? Almost every study will have caveats and limitations, and it is very important that you report them in a considered approach. You can also add ideas on how to improve your approach to eliminate important caveats that you have identified, even if this means suggesting something that adds evidence from a completely different field of biology.

My preference is not to provide all the caveats and limitations as a separate paragraph. Instead, mention them when you are discussing relevant aspects.

\hypertarget{speculation}{%
\subsection{Should you speculate in the discussion?}\label{speculation}}

Reviewers will often be unhappy with speculation in the discussion section. Speculation isn't that hard to spot, as it occurs when you make claims for which your \href{results.html}{results} have no foundation. I think that it is healthy to have one or two statements that are speculative, but clearly labelled as such. After all, after writing this paper, you are going to be one of the world experts in the topic, and thus your deeper understanding is often worth relating to the reader. However, I suggest that you speculate in combination with suggesting what work could be done in future. If you really feel that the point has to be made, you must clearly label it as speculative.

Perhaps an easier trap to fall into is over-interpretation. This is when you suggest that your \href{results.html}{results} mean more than they do. It's an easy trap to fall into, especially after setting up the study in relation to key topics in the discipline (presented in paragraph one or two of the \href{introduction.html}{introduction}). You will probably find it hard to see where you have over-interpreted, and this is something that having your work read by your advisor, or another colleague, will really help. You may then be asked to `tone down' your claim, or to place it into the direct findings of your \href{results.html}{results}.

Again, my preference is not to place all speculations or future hypotheses in the same paragraph of the discussion. These aspects should appear as the topics they relate to are discussed.

\hypertarget{dont-beat-up-on-others}{%
\subsection{Don't beat up on others}\label{dont-beat-up-on-others}}

Your \href{results.html}{results} may show that other researchers were wrong with their interpretation or findings. Whatever you may think of them, never use your discussion to be disrespectful to other researchers or their work. This has been referred to as the ``bully pulpit''. As with all aspects of professional interactions, consider how you would like to be treated, and act accordingly. This is not to say that you shouldn't point out mistakes that were made before, but be sure not to become emotive or insulting.

Generally, such comments won't get through the peer review process, and remember that you might be insulting the examiner of your thesis (or the reviewer of your paper) -- which is not likely to go down well!

\hypertarget{where-next}{%
\subsection{Where next?}\label{where-next}}

The `where next' aspect of your discussion is important as it may provide the reader with ideas for their own work. Of course, these are questions that you may wish to pursue in your own career, or they may be corroborating evidence from other disciplines that you will never undertake. Either way, making pointers for continuing aspects of the research is an important component of the discussion. Providing new lines of research may also allow you to speculate about what you consider to be the most important angle of this topic now that you have presented your \href{results.html}{results}. This should be justifyable and not gratuitous. There's no point in suggesting what other studies could be done just for the sake of it, or just because you happen to have already done them in your thesis. But if there are legitate parts of your thesis that link to your discussion of your chapter (and this is quite likely), then you should definitely point to them.

\hypertarget{last-paragraph}{%
\subsection{Last paragraph}\label{last-paragraph}}

The last paragraph of the discussion is your take home message. It's a summary paragraph that sets out what you aimed to achieve, and what the new state of understanding of the topic is now that your \href{results.html}{results} are out. This should include the key literature that can now be reconsidered.

\hypertarget{never-repeat-text}{%
\subsubsection{Never repeat text}\label{never-repeat-text}}

Please remember that while this might sound similar to your first paragraph, it is not the same. This final paragraph should not replicate any text that appears elsewhere in your chapter or manuscript (not even the abstract). Never repeat or copy text generally, even within your own chapter (or between chapters). For the reader, it's very easy to spot and it gives the impression that you have nothing to say and are simply filling space. This is not the kind of impression that you want to give your reader, especially if they are examining your work!

As always, there are a number of other places to look for more advice to write your discussion, and I'd encourage you to read as widely as possible. For example, try Hess \citeyearpar{hess2004how} and Sanli \citeyearpar{sanli2013how}.

\hypertarget{acknowledgements}{%
\section{The Acknowledgements}\label{acknowledgements}}

This is the part of your manuscript where you get to thank all of the people who have helped you along the way. It is easy to forget people and so it is worth considering making notes about who has helped you along the entire time with your PhD. Then all you have to do is remember where you wrote it down!

\hypertarget{thank-your-funders}{%
\subsection{Thank your funders}\label{thank-your-funders}}

Any people or organisations that funded you or any component of your work. Check with them they may have specific wording that they want you to use. Remember that your institution may not have given you money but may have supported you in other ways you should probably thank them. There are registers of funders, and you should use to see whether your funder is present and exactly how they should be acknowledged. One example is the \href{https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/}{Crossref Funder Registry}. Funders rely on being able to search \href{databases.html}{databases} for their name and find all of the work that they have funded. This means that you should use the particular wording that they supplied, especially if they specify this in their funding letter.

If your funders aren't in the database, you might suggest that they get added.

\hypertarget{people-and-organisations-to-thank}{%
\subsection{People and organisations to thank}\label{people-and-organisations-to-thank}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Try to remember all of those people who helped you doing fieldwork, or in the laboratory. Especially laboratory technicians without whom a lot of the work that we do isn't possible.
\item
  People that may have helped administer your funds or other office administration.
\item
  Organisations that gave you permission to do your work. In some journals the acknowledgements is the correct place to put your permit numbers along with the names of the organisations who provided them.
\item
  Increasingly, permission from ethics committees is placed in the materials and methods but do check with the journal instructions to authors.
\item
  People who supplied you with samples, images or other elements of your work or presentation of your manuscript.
\end{itemize}

Many journals have specific ways in which they want people's names to be written. You will need to follow the guidelines. For example, authors are often referred to by their initials in the acknowledgements. This is useful when some people in your paper need to thank particular funding bodies who didn't fund others.
Thank anyone who gave you a photograph that you used in the paper.

\hypertarget{who-not-to-thank-in-your-manuscript-acknowledgements}{%
\subsection{Who not to thank (in your manuscript acknowledgements)}\label{who-not-to-thank-in-your-manuscript-acknowledgements}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  You do not need to thank anyone who is an author. The exception is in your thesis acknowledgements, where you should mention them and their support.
\item
  Personally, I tend not to thank people who were paid to do a specific job and only did that job. The acknowledgements is a section to name people who have gone out of their way to help you.
\item
  Your family for getting you to grad school (unless they really helped you do the work). However, in your thesis acknowledgements, you should absolutely include your family.
\end{itemize}

If in doubt it's probably a good idea to be as inclusive as you can in the acknowledgements.

If in doubt with the acknowledgements refer to other acknowledgement sections in the same journal and see how they are formatted and written. Remember that if your journal is conducting double-blind review, they may ask for the acknowledgements (and the title page) to be removed from the main manuscript and uploaded separately.

\hypertarget{references}{%
\section{The References}\label{references}}

Putting together the reference section of your chapter or paper can take a very long time. There are quite a lot of different software packages out there to help you do this (e.g.~\href{https://endnote.com/}{Endnote}, \href{https://www.mendeley.com/guides/desktop}{Mendelay}, \href{https://www.zotero.org/}{Zotero} - see more about these \href{https://subjectguides.library.american.edu/c.php?g=479020\&p=3323781}{here}). These are a mixed blessing. Firstly, most of them are not free, so unless your university subscribes to their providers you would have to pay for the privilege of using them. Next, all of the ones that I've ever used are very demanding and do not necessarily work well with your word processor of choice. Given all the time I have invested in reference formatting software, I think I might have been better off just copying and pasting references I have at the end of a document and then formatting them by hand. This tends to be how I do it now. Having said this, I used Zotero as the referencing software for this book. It took very little time to learn how to use, it was painless to enter (most) of the references into the database, and it is free and works with \href{bookdown.org}{Bookdown} and Google Docs.

Having the references at the end of your chapter or publication is actually very important because in-text citations are not sufficient to determine exactly which paper you are referring to. Once you become very familiar with your own specific field you will find that you do glance at the references to make sure that the authors are citing the papers you think they are. It's also a great place to learn about literature that you don't know about already, and for this you need the full citation in order to look up the paper.

The right time to make sure that references are in the document is when you are writing the document. Do not leave this until the end. It has happened to me many times that I have written an in-text citation, did not paste the citation of the end of the document, and by the time I had finished writing, had forgotten what I had read and where I had read it. This then leads to a lot more time wasting trying to find that or another relevant citation.

Lots of journals are very fussy about the way that citations are given in their publications. I think it's really very cheeky especially as many of them also force you to pay for the privilege of doing all the work. There are some exceptions to this (e.g.~\href{www.peerj.com}{PeerJ}).

There are lots of better things that you could be doing with your time instead of formatting references. And so I'm not going to spend an awful long time here telling you that you must do it right. I really believe that on first submission of your manuscript you should be able to submit your references in any format. it really only makes sense for you to do all the work formatting them if you aren't going to pay to have published the paper.

There are lots of anal academics out there who will delight in looking for every missing full-stop, comma and capital-letter missing from your references. Perhaps it's because they feel secure pointing out these errors, but are incapable of knowing whether or not you've written good or bad science. Please don't join them and if you can look for a better world where you spend your valuable time doing more important things. For me, at this moment, it does not include any referencing software that I know of.

\hypertarget{DOI}{%
\subsection{Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)}\label{DOI}}

A \href{https://www.doi.org/}{DOI} is an \href{https://www.iso.org/}{ISO} unique character string to identify physical, digital or abstract objects. Their beauty is that they are persistent over time, so once issued they will always be a way to reach a particular object.

DOIs are extremely useful as you can usually click on an active link DOI and go straight to the article in question. Therefore it is well worth adding the DOI to your references if you can. Some journals will allow this (and even demand it), while others have yet to come around to how useful they are.

However, DOIs cannot replace references, otherwise we'd need to be able to click on every link all the time, and couldn't read any paper without a connection to the internet. It's still really useful to be able to read a formatted reference at the end of a paper.

\hypertarget{doi-tools}{%
\subsubsection{DOI Tools}\label{doi-tools}}

If you are writing your references by hand and need a DOI for every reference then there is this very useful online software that will provide the DOI if there is one for every reference you enter:
\href{https://doi.crossref.org/simpleTextQuery}{doi.crossref.org}

There's also an equally useful database that provides BibTex for DOIs that you enter: \href{https://doi2bib.org/}{doi2bib.org}

\hypertarget{tables}{%
\section{Tables}\label{tables}}

If you think that tables are just about displaying a series of boring numbers, then it's time to free your mind. Tables are an amazing vehicle to display information that can be numeric, written or pictorial. From the simplest of two by two tables with several levels of organisation, the reason for putting your information in a table is that you can provide it in a simpler and easier way to the reader than if you were to put all the information in full into a paragraph of text. There are few rules on Tables, but you'll find some guidelines in this Table \ref{tab:tables}.

Most journals want tables formatted so that there are only horizontal lines. This makes them easier to print, but it can make following text across a large table difficult. Shading every other row really helps with this, and if you have the option of using this in your thesis then I'd recommend it.

As a biologist, I first started to use tables to provide large quantities of numbers. Tables of morphological measurements or meristics (counts). These were always tricky to put together in word processors, until they became better integrated with spreadsheets, and now it's really easy to put these tables together and even format them in a spreadsheet and then cut and paste them into your word processor.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 2\tabcolsep) * \real{0.50}}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 2\tabcolsep) * \real{0.50}}@{}}

\hypertarget{figures}{%
\section{Figures}\label{figures}}

I consider myself to be a visual person, somebody who understands more by looking at pictures than by reading words. Not everyone is the same but there are a lot of people who can derive more information from a good figure. Therefore for me, a figure is an opportunity to convey maximum amounts of information. It can be a relatively simple figure like a graph or bar chart, a map, a conceptual diagram, or my favourite, a composite figure.

The way in which to visualise your data requires another book on the topic, as there are a myriad of decisions to make on all sorts of topics. What I provide below is a very brief start to thinking about these topics. If you need to explore more of the world of data visualisation, I suggest that you read books on this topic. Happily, people like Kieran Healy \citeyearpar{healy2018data}, Jack Dougherty and Ilya Ilyankou \citeyearpar{dougherty2021hands-on} and Claus Wilke \citeyearpar{wilke2019fundamentals} have each written such books. Claus points out that while there are ways in which you can go wrong when plotting data (such as drawing lines to infer relationships that are not there), the skills in data visualisation are more in the aesthetic and interpretive environment of what tools to use that make the data easiest to interpret. How will the figure enhance understanding of the data?

Note that the principal software used for drawing data in Dougherty \& Ilyankou's, Kieran's and Claus' books is R (\href{useR.html}{see part 1}), and the many packages that have been developed for use within the R environment \citep{rcoreteam2021r}. The distinct advantages that this produces are the almost limitless additions and details that you can make to these figures to produce exactly what you want, in a \href{vector.html}{vector format}. The drawback is that you might need to invest some time to learn how the graphics package works, and how to manipulate it to do what you want.

I agree with the approach of Dougherty and Ilyankou \citeyearpar{dougherty2021hands-on} who suggest that you start any figure by mapping out what you want to convey and how. Sketch this out and discuss it with your advisor.

\hypertarget{graphs}{%
\subsection{Graphs}\label{graphs}}

You should be aware of all the things that make up a good graph already. here I'm going to provide some extra pointers on what I think is important and should be considered when drawing a good graph:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Labels}. This seems completely obvious and yet it is a common problem with submitted papers. Axes should be labelled with both an explanation and the units in which they were measured.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Capitals}. Be consistent in capitalising labels and other words in your figure. Avoid using just capitals (e.g.~ALL CAPITALS ARE DIFFICULT TO READ AND UNSIGHTLY)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{The scale}. make sure that the numbers of the scale are large enough to read even when the figure is reduced the size that it will be printed on the page. This includes the text that crossed the axes.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If you have used a log scale, make sure that this is prominently labelled.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Data points}. I am a great fan of including all the data points that go to make up any summary statistic that is displayed on the graph. Thus, if you provide a mean or something like a box plot for your x-axis category, then please add all data points as well. This can be done using the jitter function in R.
\item
  Don't draw relationships that aren't there. The ease of plotting graphs makes it possible to display relationships between data points that don't exist. This is most commonly done across a set of discrete measurements when a continuous line links them without any data to suggest this relationship. Be especially careful when plotting lines that you can infer a continuous value between points plotted.
\item
  Compiling graphs. if you have a series of graphs that share the same x or y axis then consider compiling them together. This essentially turns them into a composite figure, but it often means that readers can compare data easily from one graph to another. remember that you will have to make sure that the scales on the shared access are all the same.
\item
  Use consistent symbols and colours throughout your thesis. Your thesis will likely plot data on similar variables in many ways throughout. By using consistent symbols (e.g.~circles for females and triangles for males) and colours throughout the thesis for the variables that chapters have in common, you will help your reader understand a figure much more quickly. The consistency of the graphical environment of a thesis will facilitate understanding.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Consistency is especially important across panels within a composite figure.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Colour. The reason for all the fuss about not having colour in figures is mostly to do with the extra cross cost involved in printing them. Typically these days it is possible to use colour in figures and for these to be reproduced without any extra charge online. Thus if the data that you have is best shown with colour then use colour. There are some things to be mindful of when using colour.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Colour blindness: This affects quite a large portion of the population, particularly men. To avoid using colours that can be easily confused simply look them up for example here
  \item
    Printing colour in monochrome: some people still like to print out papers in order to read them, annotate them or share them at a journal club. using a monochrome printer many colours are indistinguishable. you can therefore change the hue or intensity of a colour to make sure that it can be distinguished when it is printed.
  \item
    Aesthetic quality: some colours don't go well together. a lot of people have already determined this and you can find a good guide \href{https://colorbrewer2.org/\#type=sequential\&scheme=BuGn\&n=3}{here}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{maps}{%
\subsection{Maps}\label{maps}}

There are many reasons why you might need to include a map in your paper when writing for biological sciences. I find that the easiest way of creating Maps is to use GIS software like QGIS or ArcGIS. Both of these require a good degree of learning in order to master. To have a map with sampling points is relatively straight forward. Especially with QGIS you can watch `how to' videos on the internet to learn most of what you need to know. things to remember when you're drawing a map:
If your map is a detailed view of an area then consider a small context map in the corner showing where your area is
- Include the scale
- Provide a North arrow especially if you have rotated the view
- Some journals require a specific mention of the geographic projection \href{https://www.gislounge.com/map-projection/}{see here}, or to provide a citation for each layer of the map (which makes sense when you think about it). Thus it's a good policy to make sure you know the provenance of the layers that you are using.
- When using colour see \href{https://colorbrewer2.org/\#type=sequential\&scheme=BuGn\&n=3}{these} handy sets of colours to use at Colorbrewer.
- Make sure that any points you have included are big enough so that you can see the point and the shape of a point when the figure is reduced
- Strictly speaking maps in figures should not have embedded legends (keys). The correct way to explain symbols is to do it in the figure legend. However, sometimes if there are many different symbols it is more expedient to use an embedded legend.

\hypertarget{maximising-the-content-of-your-figure}{%
\subsubsection{Maximising the content of your figure}\label{maximising-the-content-of-your-figure}}

Sometimes you will have the option of including more information in a figure than the original plan that you started with. This is perhaps especially true when it comes to producing maps with GIS, because you have the option of adding extra data layers. But remember that this information should not be gratuitous. In figure \ref{fig:not-fancy}, we can see a map that shows a number of sampling sites. The map has a scale bar and north arrow as needed.



\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/not-fancy} 

}

\caption{\textbf{A plain map can give all the information needed.} This map adequately shows the positions of sample sites (or anything else) as red points within the southern African region.}\label{fig:not-fancy}
\end{figure}

However, it is relatively simple to add more information to this map in the form of layers. In figure \ref{fig:fancy-map}, a digital elevation model (DEM) allows us to see the relative elevation at the sampling points, while transparent colours provide information about the different biomes in which the samples were made. Lastly, I've used a piece of sea to insert an image of the species sampled. There is also a reference map (top left) showing the area of southern Africa where the sampling points occur. This figure is now much more informative, and has greater aesthetic appeal to me, but all of this added information is only of use if relevant to the manuscript or chapter.



\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/fancy-map} 

}

\caption{\textbf{Maps tend to have a lot of space, and GIS provides the opportunity to add layers to give rich information, as well as improving aesthetics.} This map shows lots more information about the biomes in which each of the sample sites (red dots) falls, the elevation and an image of the species sampled. Inset of Africa (top left) shows the area sampled with a red square. I've also managed to fit in an image of the species sampled into the sea (bottom right).}\label{fig:fancy-map}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{conceptual-diagram}{%
\subsection{Conceptual diagram}\label{conceptual-diagram}}

Conceptual diagrams or figures are very useful in the introduction or methods when you have undertaken a complex study design. There are many different ways of doing this, but essentially the information needs to be conveyed in a way that is more simple in the figure than writing it out. Boxes and arrows are sufficient for most purposes. If the figure gets too complicated to understand, it's probably of little use.

I encourage my students to draw conceptual diagrams of how the thesis chapters relate to one another, and then to include this diagram in the introduction to the thesis to help examiners and any other readers to understand how the chapters are interrelated.

I suggest that it is also very useful when you're undertaking a review to draw a conceptual diagram for yourself of what you were trying to achieve. This may or may not then be included in the review when it comes to publishing.

In order to make your conceptual diagram clear the following points should be followed:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Keep any text in the diagram large enough so that when it is reduced to printing size it can still be read
\item
  Try not to write full sentences but just notes
\item
  Make use of arrows to show how ideas are related
\item
  Look at other conceptual diagrams especially those that resonate with you as a reader
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{the-composite-figure}{%
\subsection{The composite figure}\label{the-composite-figure}}

For me, composite figures started when I noticed other papers were including small pictures of species in phylogenies. As a reader I really liked this way of understanding more about the animals that were being studied. The composite figure also comes about by making use of blank spaces that naturally occur within figures. Many graphs have large white spaces toward the top (left or right), and small images of study animals, cartoons of study designs or systems can be inserted to improve the immediate recognition of what the figure is portraying.

\hypertarget{ideas-for-composite-figures}{%
\subsubsection{Ideas for composite figures:}\label{ideas-for-composite-figures}}

include a picture of the subject species in a small corner of blank space in one of your figures. For example, maps with a large area of sea (If your subject is a terrestrial species) are especially good for this (see Figure \ref{fig:fancy-map}).

\hypertarget{sending-your-graphics-file-to-the-publisher}{%
\subsection{Sending your graphics file to the publisher}\label{sending-your-graphics-file-to-the-publisher}}

One consistent problem is the lack of understanding that authors have for different file types. I can be rather confusing as these are stated in lots of different ways, and often in units that are not intuitive. Journals usually have long and detailed explanations of how to do this in their instructions to authors, yet this is one of the most common difficulties that authors have. I will provide a brief overview of the most common problems, but better overviews exist and I encourage you to read them \citep[e.g.][]{wilke2019fundamentals}.

Be aware that the publisher won't be able to change anything within your figure, like the fonts. This means that you will need to use the same font in your figures as stipulated by the journal (in the instructions to authors). You also need to be critical of the size of any fonts that you use so that they can be seen even if the figure is reduced to fit the page width, or half page width. Be especially careful of numbers on scales as well as labels.

Most publishers will require you to name the files of your figures to correspond with their instructions to authors. If they don't have specific requirements, then use clear file names (e.g.~Figure\_1.png), and not cryptic ones. Remember that each figure needs a single file, so if you have produced a composite figure, then you will need to output this as a single graphics file.

\hypertarget{vector}{%
\subsubsection{Vectors vs bitmaps}\label{vector}}

The biggest difference among image types are the difference between vectors (a line drawn between two points) and bitmaps (using pixels to create images). Vector diagrams will produce superior images on screen that will allow you to zoom in without loss of resolution (e.g.~svg, eps, pdf). With a bitmap, the more you zoom, the more you will be able to see the pixels that make up the figure. If at all possible, create your figures using vector graphics (such as in R or drawing software such as Adobe Illustrator), and store them in this format. The only exceptions will be images (e.g.~png, jpg, tif, raw, gif, bmp) that you add to composite figures, insert these with the highest resolution available.

If your figure is a photograph (or another tonal image type), then it will have to be a bitmap. However, if you have a line drawing, try to get it output as a vector rather than a bitmap as not only will the quality be better, but your options for editing and improving will be greater (should the editor require this).

\hypertarget{sizing-your-figure}{%
\subsubsection{Sizing your figure}\label{sizing-your-figure}}

When you export your graphic from the graphics package that you are using to draw it, specify the resolution (most often in dpi: dots per inch) given by the publisher. Minimum resolution for photos and tone images is 400 dpi, and 600 dpi for line drawings. Remember that the dpi will change if the size of your figure changes. Hence you must know the printed size of your figure (in cm or inches) on the page. This is usually either one or two columns. Rarely, a journal might allow you to use landscape instead of portrait for a figure. As a rule, you should use the page setup in your package to specify the output size of your figure (page layout function) before you start, and then set the resolution before you export the figure. It's always possible to draw at a higher resolution and convert to a lower resolution. Low resolution images need to be redrawn to make them higher resolution.

If you are using R, you can specify your graphical output in your coding. If you are using a GUI \href{https://www.rstudio.com/}{(like R Studio)}, you can choose to export as an image (i.e.~bitmap) or pdf (i.e.~vector). R Studio will allow you to set a generic or custom page size before you save.

\hypertarget{the-figure-legend}{%
\subsection{The figure legend}\label{the-figure-legend}}

The most important point with the figure Legend is that it should be a stand-alone explanation of what is in the figure. The reader should not have to refer to the text in order to understand what is in the figure. For example, if the figure is about a species then species name should be included in full. The explanation of any variables or categories needs to be provided. But it should not be taken to absurd levels, is not a reason to repeat everything that's in the materials and methods. Take a look at some figure legends that are already published in the journal that you are hoping to submit to and you should have a good idea of what to write. Figure legends need to be full, grammatically correct sentences.

Remember that the figure legend is placed underneath the embedded figure in your thesis. This means that the itself graphic should not have any title. Traditional submissions to journals require figure legends to be at the end of the manuscript, before the figures themselves. Many journals now allow you to embed a lower resolution image of the figure on first submission together with the legend underneath in order to facilitate peer review. Check on the requirements for you institution or journal before finalising this.

A trend with online journals is that each figure (and table) needs a topic or title sentence, followed by a description. This is a good way forward with any figure legend. Both need to be uploaded along with the image file when you submit the manuscript.

\hypertarget{credit}{%
\section{Who did what?}\label{credit}}

More and more journals are asking authors to supply information about who did what. This is an attempt to increase transparency and reduce the incidence of ghost authorship.

There are a lot of politics around authorship. How do you decide whether or not someone did enough to be included on an author line. This is a very important point that we cover elsewhere. All that I will say here is that this should have been decided early on in the study. Everyone should know whether or not they are going to be an author at the time that they participate. No one should ever find out but they were not an author by reading their name in the acknowledgements.

\hypertarget{credit-where-its-due}{%
\subsection{CRediT where it's due}\label{credit-where-its-due}}

After many iterations, there is now a widely recognised list of 14 different ways in which authors can contribute towards a study (Table \ref{tab:CRediT}). Even when the study is a chapter in your PhD thesis, it's unlikely that you can put your name next to every role in the CRediT taxonomy. This does give you some realistic perspective about the collaborative nature of science.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}l@{}}
\caption{\label{tab:CRediT} \textbf{There is now a recognised list of different ways in which authors contribute to publications.} The CRediT taxonomy allows you to ascribe contributions from each of the authors into one or more of 14 different roles.}\tabularnewline

If you want to know more about each of these roles and how they Are defined in the CRediT taxonomy then please visit the site. You can also `claim' these roles under your \href{https://rescognito.com/}{Rescognito profile}, linked to your ORCID account.

Even if the journal that you are submitting to does not use the credit taxonomy I would suggest that you use this as the basis for your saying who did what in the publication. See a blog article on this \href{http://crosstalk.cell.com/blog/giving-authors-the-credit-they-deserve}{here}. Otherwise you could end up with what is known as hyperauthorship, a phenomenon evidenced by massive co-authorship levels \citep{cronin2001hyperauthorship}.

\hypertarget{ordering-the-author-line-up}{%
\subsection{Ordering the author line up}\label{ordering-the-author-line-up}}

In Biological Sciences it is traditional for the author who did most of the work to take the first position. For you and your thesis you are most likely to be the first author, certainly for all of your thesis chapters.

The last position is normally for the head of the laboratory in which the work was undertaken. This would usually be your advisor, but could be another collaborator, if for example, you went to do some work in their laboratory. Funding also plays a role here, and if you are unsure about who should be listed last, then ask your advisor.

In between the first and last authors is a bit of a no-man's land. Some people order it by who did most (closest to first), but then there is also a push to be closest to last place (closest to being more senior). Alphabetical also works, but that often benefits or penalises those who have names that regularly appear higher up or lower down in the alphabet. One colleague is always first to suggest alphabetical order as he regularly ends up as last author. If it isn't part of your thesis, should you still be an author?

There is such a thing as shared first (and even last) authorship. You see these appearing with increasing regularity, marked with an asterisk or other symbol. Hence, there can be several top spots, and these should work just fine for your CV.

\hypertarget{suppinfo}{%
\section{Supplementary Material}\label{suppinfo}}

Twenty years ago, the idea of supplementary material for a journal article was practically unheard of. Today, it seems that few papers don't have some supplementary material associated with them. Why this big change?

\hypertarget{what-can-go-into-supplementary-material}{%
\subsection{What can go into Supplementary Material?}\label{what-can-go-into-supplementary-material}}

Practically anything!

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If you have lots of extra analyses that are too large to go into an article.
\item
  If your methods are extensive and there's a word limit in the journal
\item
  If your analytical tools throw out a bunch of super interesting graphics, but you can only use one or two
\item
  Most of all, you can put in the raw data that makes up the basis for your work, together with the analytical script that you used to analyse it.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{there-has-been-a-big-movement-toward-transparency-and-repeatability-of-scientific-studies}{%
\subsection{There has been a big movement toward transparency and repeatability of scientific studies}\label{there-has-been-a-big-movement-toward-transparency-and-repeatability-of-scientific-studies}}

This is a really positive movement in science and it should receive all of our support as it is part of the greater scientific project \href{transparency.html}{see part 2}. Being proud of your work is being proud of the entire product, including the data and the analysis. If you felt they were good enough for peer review, then you should be happy to make them all freely available. Not sure if you haven't made some mistakes? We all make mistakes and you shouldn't think that you will have an entirely fault free career. Whenever and wherever possible conduct your professional due diligence and be open and honest with your research. Science is a career when we should welcome errors and mistakes that we have made in the past. There's no problem with this. Indeed, the problems only start when you refuse to acknowledge past errors and mistakes, making you prone to motivated reasoning and confirmation bias.

There are lots of data repositories out there. Some specialise in particular kinds of data, like genetic data in \href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/}{GenBank}, or sound data in \href{https://www.macaulaylibrary.org/}{The Macaulay Library} at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Others are general repositories of data and you can post anything there, including the scripts that you used to analyse the data. By doing this you ensure that any people that want to use your work in the future have full access to it. Your data deposit will be given a DOI. You can use this DOI in your publication so that readers know where to find the data.

Once I happily allowed the publishers to store my data. These days, I simply don't trust them to curate and keep my data for posterity. The way that most publishers of academic journals behave, there is no reason for them to make sure that my data is safe and secure. Therefore, I would rather go to an independent curator of data that specialises in not-for-profit data curation. One example is \href{https://zenodo.org/}{Zenodo} which is built and operated by CERN and OpenAIRE. This site has the advantage that it is integrated with GitHub (if you are already a user, but check it out if you aren't). You can choose to open your data immediately, or embargo it until your paper is published. It's a great platform, and so much more secure than using a publisher. Another example is the \href{https://osf.io/}{Open Science Framework (OSF)} that aims to be a one stop shop for all of your storage needs. OSF best practices can be found here. You will need to make sure that your data is correctly sorted with sufficient metadata for someone else to understand \citep[see][]{roche2015public}.

Once we did statistical analysis with a GUI and a point and click approach. Forget to click a checkbox and the results were not repeatable. As the analyses have become increasingly sophisticated with more and differing pieces of software, it is becoming increasingly important to record the code that you write that gets your results together with your data. This is the difference between making your results and therefore your study repeatable.

Talk to your advisor. Your lab or your institution may have a repository that they prefer.

\hypertarget{why-stop-with-just-depositing-your-data-and-analyses-online}{%
\subsection{Why stop with just depositing your data and analyses online?}\label{why-stop-with-just-depositing-your-data-and-analyses-online}}

Let's face it, you probably put a lot of effort into proposing your thesis hypotheses. Why not deposit this too? Remember that it does not have to be accessible to the world, but it would improve the integrity of your study if your original hypotheses are the same as the ones that you submit for publication. Some journals are now asking whether you have stored hypotheses ahead of conducting the experiments. They don't stop you from submitting if you haven't. But why not? It's a great step forward in terms of transparency and provides more credibility when you eventually write that manuscript with the same aims. And it shouldn't stop you from publishing another study that happened along the way, even though you hadn't planned it. I suspect that in future funders will require us to deposit our successful funding proposals in an online repository before they release funds - hopefully they'll also be willing to support these facilities financially.

\hypertarget{formatting}{%
\chapter{Formatting your thesis}\label{formatting}}

Let's face it, after spending so much time writing your thesis, having it formatted so that it looks very smart for submission is gratifying.

If you chose \href{bookdown.org}{Bookdown} or \href{thesisdown.org}{thesisdown} to write your thesis in, then you'll simply be able to download the correct style file (cls) and bibliography formatting file (bib) and press the build book button in \href{www.rstudio.com}{RStudio} and you'll have your formatted thesis in the time that it takes your computer to render the pdf. You'll still need to look through it and make sure that the output is what you want.

For other, mere mortals, using word-processing packages, you will likely need to invest a lot more time trying to pull together the chapters of your thesis into the correct format. (I'd suggest that right now is not the time to learn Bookdown - unless you are way ahead of schedule!) Try to make it a fun event by listening to your favourite music (very loudly) or having some of your banned tipple (do both if you dare!). It doesn't require the same level of creative concentration required when writing your thesis, but it does need great attention to detail.

Be patient and don't try to build mega-big files in word-processing documents, they tend to crash. Instead, copy the template file and compile one chapter at a time, placing them together only at the end for a final build.

Your university will have their own stipulation for exactly how they want the thesis formatted. Here, I provide a check-list for the last things to do before you submit. The chances are that your university will have a bunch of helpful links. Make sure that you follow the guidelines of your own institution well in advance of submitting your thesis.

\hypertarget{must-do-check-list-before-submitting-your-thesis}{%
\subsection{Must do check-list before submitting your thesis:}\label{must-do-check-list-before-submitting-your-thesis}}

The following points are based on what may irritate or annoy your examiner (and you really don't want to do that!):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Spell check - yes, it sounds obvious but doing a final spell check is a good idea. Not only this, but take the time to have your word processor ignore or add all of the special words (e.g.~species or site names) that it doesn't otherwise recognise. This will ensure their consistency throughout (within and between chapters).
\item
  Make sure that your language settings are set to `UK English' (or the English setting for where you are based.
\item
  Look out especially for words that have different accepted spellings like those ending in -ise or -ize. Decide which you want and be consistent. Consistency is king!
\item
  Capitalisation of \href{taxonomy.html}{common names}, place names and not adjectives. For example, `South Africa' has two capitals, but `southern Africa' only has one.
\item
  Grammar check - always good to take a final look, especially for chapters that you wrote some time ago.
\item
  Use the word processor automated options to help you.
\item
  Have your computer or another device read the text so that you can hear anything obviously wrong.
\item
  Pay attention if you have used ``we'' or ``I'' and make sure they are consistent in your thesis. As a rule I encourage ``I'' in a thesis, unless the chapter is also a manuscript, in which case ``we'' is usually correct.
\item
  Page layout. Really important to get this right in your template. Make sure that your template has:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Correct paper size (A4 and not US letter - or visa versa!)
  \item
    Margins
  \item
    Line spacing
  \item
    Page numbers
  \item
    Line numbers (really helps your examiners)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Headers and Footers. If you can manage a chapter specific header, it's useful to show your name and a short chapter title.
\item
  Sections and subheadings. I've encouraged you to use subheadings throughout your thesis. Here you have a chance to number them sequentially. This is very useful for your examiners and may be a requirement for the university. Using the \href{software.html}{word processor's} built in functions will make this task consistent and easy.
\item
  I dislike writing within a formatted document (as word processors can start getting weird), so my preference is to cut and paste written text into a template at the end.
\item
  Remember to give them a check through before handing it in. If you've done the sections correctly, then the contents page will come out right.
\item
  \href{title:html}{Title page} - prescribed very strictly by the university. The librarians place the SU watermark after final submission to the library. It may be tempting to change your title now that you know what's in the thesis, but many universities have strict policies about this. If you want to change the title, make sure that you are able to do so.
\item
  Content page - word processors can do this automatically if your thesis is formatted correctly throughout (see sections and subheadings above).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    You can check this to make sure that you've done all of your sections and subheadings correctly.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \href{acknowledgements.html}{Acknowledgements} - this is your time to say thank you to all the special people that have helped during your study. There are probably more than you realise, but in addition to your friends and family (who most people don't forget), think about the people who administered the work, lab mates (past and present) who were always there to help, and people who gave permission at study sites.
\item
  \href{references.html}{References} - probably one of the most dreaded sections of any thesis preparation, but they do have to be done. If you're one of these people that has everything in a \href{database.html}{database}, then you'll be laughing or cursing your database throughout. While it might be tempting to only look through the data within the database, spend some time to see how it's displayed in the thesis. A mistake in the reference database will be multiplied many times in the thesis. Remember that examiners love to take a random look through the reference section to make sure that it's all good. After years of painfully entering references themselves, they know just what to look for.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{mistakes-people-make}{%
\subsection{Mistakes people make:}\label{mistakes-people-make}}

Other than the obvious things, all mentioned above, here are some of the mistakes I've seen.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Submitting the wrong version (yes this does happen!). Probably worse if having a mixture of right and wrong versions for different chapters (worse because it takes longer to sort out)
\item
  Last minute additions to text with incorrect spelling and or grammar
\item
  Two correctly spelled synonyms sitting next to each other when only one is desired (probably came about when editing)
\item
  Forgetting to check for plagiarism (see here)
\item
  Comments and or edited text (especially when it's marked as being by someone other than the student).
\item
  Page numbers that start again and again at different sections
\item
  Lots of blank pages or spaces (avoid blank pages if you can, and try to limit the amount of blank space (never \textgreater half a page).

  Leaving important people out of the acknowledgements (e.g.~advisor, administrators, funders, etc.)

\chapter*{The obligatoin to publish your work}\label{publish}}


Now that you've submitted your PhD, you need still need to do something with it. For most of you this will be publishing it in a journal of your choice. It will then take you through what happens to the manuscript and give you insight about where you might want to publish, how to choose the journal. Publication is important. Here is a list of reasons why you have some obligation to publish the work in your thesis:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If your work is unpublished, then it will not be used. Without use, all the work that you put into it falls away.
\item
  Your published work will become the foundation for future students and academics who are active in your field. This might well be in another country or on another continent.
\item
  Your work was most likely paid for by tax-payers in the country where you studied. Publishing this work is a way of handing back the value of what you found. If it is published Open Access, the public can also read it for themselves.
\item
  Other funders of your thesis work may have made publication a prerequisite of the funding criteria.
\item
  It is hoped that by publishing your work it will become more accessible to the scientific community.
\item
  By publishing your work you will find that both you, and your work, become known by an international community that may well invite you to participate in the academic process further \citep{marks2013misuse}.
\item
  Both inside and outside of science as a career, peer reviewed published papers are seen as an important accomplishment in addition to the production of your thesis.
\item
  The work that you have already put into your thesis (especially if you have followed the advice in this book!), will mean that you are close to having chapters that can be submitted as publications.
\item
  Your advisor and lab colleagues who helped with your thesis work may depend on your publications.
\item
  There is a lot of satisfaction to be had by seeing your work published. It has been argued that this depends on who you are and where you come from \citep{husemann2017publicationism}.
\item
  The satisfaction of having someone say how enjoyable or inspiring your work is to read will certainly not be as frequent as if you managed to publish a novel or newspaper column. But when it does happen, it will bring a smile to your face.
\end{itemize}

This is by no means an exhaustive list, but I hope it will give you some insight into the importance of publishing your results. To counter this assertion, please be aware that there is also research that suggests that publication driven science is not healthy, and that we need a new way to motivate science \citep[e.g.][]{stergiou2014impact}. Indeed, it has been suggested that the `publish or perish' mentality of academia has resulted in the retention (and even deterioration) of poor experimental design, and hence higher false positives in the behavioural sciences \citep{smaldino2016natural}. However, before you can join the debate about the future, I'd argue that you need to provide your credentials for the present.

Taking your work to the next level is not a trivial step, even though you already have your chapters written in the style of manuscripts. The challenges of publishing work, like other challenges in academia, are much easier if you possess inside knowledge of the system. The demystification of the next steps along the road in academia are the subject of another book:

I really hope that this book has been helpful and that it has achieved what I set out to do: provide you with the guide on how to write a PhD in biological sciences. If you feel that this book has important items missing, out-of-date or simply wrong, then please help. Any good guide relies upon the people that use it to keep it viable.

You can contribute to the project at the Github pages for this book, using bookdown.

If I could emphasise one really important aspect of all of your PhD studies; that is to enjoy them!
