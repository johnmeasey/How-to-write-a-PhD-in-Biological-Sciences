<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 12</span> Why do you need to cite?</h1>
<p>Citations are a means of recognising that your work is built on the work of others. They are part of the fundamental tenets of science that we don’t start from scratch each time we conduct a study.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Isaac Newton (in a letter to Robert Hooke in 1675) wrote:<br />
<strong>“If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the phrase is often attributed to Isaac Newton, it turns out that it was well accepted in Newton’s time and has been traced back to the 12th century.</p>
<p>Essentially, standing on the shoulders of giants (Figures <a href="citations.html#fig:Googlescholar">12.1</a> is a recognition that all research is built upon research that has gone before it, and this is the basis for citations in the text of scientific papers. Patrick Dunleavy <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-dunleavy2017citations" role="doc-biblioref">Dunleavy 2017</a>)</span> argues that citations are required to meet 7 criteria with respect to academic writing. Others have suggested that there are more criteria <span class="citation">(see <a href="references-1.html#ref-harwood2009interview" role="doc-biblioref">Harwood 2009</a>)</span>, and that these are a fundamental premise of academic work. But it was not always thus. If we dwell a moment longer, we can look back at the World’s longest running scientific journal: <em>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.</em></p>
<p>You can download the first of those papers of 1665 and note that there are no citations (other than to books or letters) because there were no previously published articles from which to draw. However, even then authors noted that ideas came from previous authors and we can regularly find acknowledgements that refer back to Aristotle (~350 BC).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.1</span> Research is built on existing work and ideas</h2>
<p>It would therefore be very unlikely that your idea/ideas has no basis in existing literature. If you can’t find it, the chances are that you haven’t looked in the right way. Try Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science and vary the search terms or try searching for articles citing something similar.</p>
<p>Citations demonstrate to readers where your ideas have come from. Citations can also be used to reduce what you need to write – especially with respect to methodology. If you (or others) have already provided the methodology in full then you can give a much simpler description and the citation.</p>
<p>Citations need to be used to back up any statements of fact that you make in your PhD chapter. Any examples need citations for where the examples came from, and when you make <a href="argument.html">arguments</a>, you add credibility to your arguments from each side by citing that these are from published works.</p>
</div>
<div id="your-citations-say-a-lot-about-you" class="section level2" number="12.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.2</span> Your citations say a lot about you</h2>
<p>When you choose to cite one paper over another, you are making a statement about what you find credible in the literature and what you don’t. For example, if you choose to cite a poorly conducted study as the cornerstone for one of your arguments, then others may interpret that your arguments are built on shaky foundations. Experienced (often senior) readers who know the literature well will be able to judge the quality of your work not only by what you’ve written, but on what you’ve based your ideas through your citations. As we will see later on, there’s a lot to think about when deciding what to cite, and what not to cite.</p>
</div>
<div id="cite-while-you-write-not-afterwards" class="section level2" number="12.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.3</span> Cite while you write (not afterwards)</h2>
<p>Automatically, I’d suggest that you cite whenever you write. Using citations becomes habit forming, and you’ll end up wanting to use citations everywhere. Popular scientific writings tend not to have citations, but they can still be there but subtly different.</p>
<p>Within a manuscript for a scientific journal or in your thesis, you can expect that your <a href="introduction.html">introduction</a> and <a href="discussion.html">discussion</a> sections are going to be full of citations. The methodology will likely also be citation rich. By using a lot of citations in your methods, you can often save your needing to write a lot of sections which would otherwise be very detailed.</p>
<p>Later in the book (<a href="formula.html">Writing with a Formula</a>), I explain how to start writing with an outline, then flesh out the outline with citations from your reading, and plan which citations you are going to use carefully before you start. This won’t stop you from adding more later, but this ensures that your work is built on your scholarly endeavour.</p>
<p>I’ve seen many students try to write their text first and then only later fill in citations. I’ve had students hand in thesis chapters and manuscripts that have [ref] written strategically at the end of many sentences. I’ve even had the experience of doing this myself when I was a early career researcher (I probably still have those manuscripts somewhere because it’s a sure way of never getting anything finished). I suggest that you <strong>do not do this.</strong> The reason is that if you write first and try to insert citations later, you are going to spend lots of time looking for the citation that fits your text. This is clearly not the right way around. Your text should be based on what’s present in the literature.</p>
<p>I was planning to write that no-one would ever write an entire manuscript without references, and then put them all in at the end. Then I came across a video by <a href="https://youtu.be/yk54_j3-4RM">Pat Schloss</a>, and realised that I’m wrong <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-schloss2018riffomonas" role="doc-biblioref">Schloss 2018</a>)</span>. Pat states early on (in the video) that he prefers to write first and cite later. He’s clearly a very experienced researcher and knows his literature very well. Indeed, he knows it all so well that he already knows what citations fit what statements without needing to look them up. However, later on in the video Pat admits that even he sometimes gets it wrong, and that means that he ends up having to rewrite text when he finds the publication that he was thinking of and notes that what they actually found did not fit what he wrote. Although I can identify with what Pat is saying, I would find this re-writing far too time consuming to take this approach myself. I am familiar with most of the pertinent literature in my specialist area, but I’d rather check things before I start writing than leave it until later. I find that my memory is not only wrong about what other people have found, but also about what’s in my own work. Therefore, I’d suggest that while you may aspire to write like Pat later on in your career, right now it’d be better for you to plan your writing with citations in mind, and cite while you write (not afterwards).</p>
<p>When you submit a draft of your chapter to your advisor, they may suggest additional citations that are known to them. Don’t simply add blindly, but look them up and check their relevance to the statement concerned. They may require recrafting of the statement, or a query back to your advisor.</p>

<div id="citation-styles" class="section level2" number="12.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.4</span> Citation Styles</h2>
<p>There are a number of different styles, and this is likely to depend on the journal that you are writing for <span class="citation">(see <a href="references-1.html#ref-pandey2020methods" role="doc-biblioref">Pandey et al. 2020</a>)</span>. The two most prevalent styles in biological sciences are often referred to as Harvard (name, year) and Vancouver<sup>1</sup> (superscript numbers that are listed in the reference section). Most universities and journals require Harvard style. The intricacies of how exactly this will get carried out will change from institution to institution and journal to journal. You will have to find out what is relevant to you.</p>
<div id="vancouver-style" class="section level3" number="12.4.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">12.4.1</span> Vancouver Style</h3>
<p>Vancouver style dates back to medical journals in the 1970s and refer to conventions to avoid fraud in medical sciences. In biological sciences, they are not used as widely as Harvard style, but are chosen as they don’t impede the flow of the text for the reader.</p>
<p>Each style has its pros and cons. Vancouver style is more equitable and anonymous, as all cited people are represented only in the references and do not have their names plastered throughout the text. The diminutive numbers take up less space, allowing the reader and writer to concentrate more on their prose. On the other hand, if you are familiar with the literature, or you are interested in learning more about the literature, you’ll find that the little numbers take much more time to cross reference with the list at the end, than does Harvard style. Reference strings in Vancouver style can either be separate numbers, or numbers listed as a series. Because citations are numbered in the order in which they first mentioned, citation strings later in documents often end up as a list of non-sequential numbers separated by commas.</p>
<p>Here is an example of text <span class="citation">(from <a href="references-1.html#ref-measey2016global" role="doc-biblioref">Measey et al. 2016</a>)</span> with citations in Vancouver style:</p>

<div id="harvard-style" class="section level3" number="12.4.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">12.4.2</span> Harvard Style</h3>
<p>The standard way is to use the name and year in parentheses at the end of the statement to which the citation is relevant. Names of three or more authors are frequently reduced to “et al.” (often written in italics) which is short for the Latin et alia, meaning “and others.” References strings in Harvard style can go on for an entire line of text or more. Some journals have rules that mean on first mention the citation should have all authors (up to a certain number). This can become tedious when citations start taking up more space than text.</p>
<p>A repeat of the above example, except with Harvard style shows how much more space these same citations take up.</p>

<p>From here on (and throughout the book - because the book uses a form of Harvard style), I concentrate on Harvard style as this provides more freedom for how citations can differ.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="moving-from-harvard-to-vancouver" class="section level2" number="12.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.5</span> Moving from Harvard to Vancouver</h2>
<p>Essentially, every time you would have had the year and date, you will replace this with a superscript denoting the number for that particular citation. However, Vancouver style does not allow for much variation in how you cite. You can’t use (e.g. <sup>1,2</sup>) or (see <sup>3</sup> for a review). This means that when you originally wrote for a Harvard style journal, but then change the manuscript to submit it to a journal that uses Vancouver style, you’ll need to remove any explanations of citations. That doesn’t mean removing the citations themselves, but it may mean re-writing some sentences. Simply changing your reference manager to use the different referencing style will only be the start of your work.</p>
</div>
<div id="where-within-a-sentence-should-the-citation-come" class="section level2" number="12.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.6</span> Where within a sentence should the citation come?</h2>
<p>There are a number of different styles, and this is likely to depend on the journal that you are writing for. The standard way is to use the name and year in parentheses at the end of the statement to which the citation is relevant.</p>
<p>The impact of all invasive amphibians is similar to that of invasive birds and mammals <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-measey2016global" role="doc-biblioref">Measey et al. 2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>You’ll see that sometimes the names are brought into the sentence and become the central agents of the text. The phrase et alii (often abbreviated to et al.), literally means “and others” referring to the other authors (typically used when there are more than two - but check the journal format!).</p>
<p>Sometimes, instead of “et al.” you can write “and colleagues” or “and others.” This is something to do occasionally when you are looking to diversify some text. Don’t over do it though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Measey et al. <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-measey2016global" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> found that the impact of invasive amphibians is comparable to that of birds and mammals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This technique is very useful when you then want to add another sentence or two about this same study.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Measey et al. <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-measey2016global" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> found that the impact of invasive amphibians is comparable to that of birds and mammals. They did this by constructing GISS scores for all individuals in all groups.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because the authors are the subjects of the first sentence, the citation becomes implicit in the second sentence. Then you don’t need to use the same citation again within the paragraph.</p>
<p>What about page numbers?
Sometimes you’ll see a citation with a colon and page number after. This really only needs to be used if you are quoting specific text on a particular page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Measey et al. <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-measey2016global" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>: 976)</span> proposed that using GISS scores could show that “some amphibians can have devastating impacts to the environment.”</p>

</div>
<div id="what-about-the-order-of-the-citations-in-a-string" class="section level2" number="12.7">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.7</span> What about the order of the citations in a string?</h2>
<p>A citation string is a list of two or more citations that all assert the statement given. When you provide a string of citations you will need to decide which one comes first. Normally, this is given in the order of precedence: the oldest citation comes first, the youngest last. However, journals have their own styles and these may dictate how citation strings are ordered. For example, they could be alphabetical. If your referencing software has a style then you can relax. Otherwise, you’ll need to look it up!</p>
</div>
<div id="what-about-citations-as-taxonomic-authorities" class="section level2" number="12.8">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.8</span> What about citations as taxonomic authorities?</h2>
<p>Taxonomists have special rules for this, and I’ll do it in another chapter (see section on <a href="taxonomy.html">Scientific names and taxonomic authorities</a>). These are not the same as regular citations (because they don’t appear in the literature cited and you don’t have to have read the descriptions), and only some journals ask for them.</p>
</div>
<div id="is-it-possible-to-mis-cite" class="section level2" number="12.9">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.9</span> Is it possible to mis-cite?</h2>
<p>Yes. One of the most common ways in which students mis-cite a paper is to use statements made in the introduction (or discussion) which were not the subject of the study. For example, in the introduction of their paper, Measey et al. <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-measey2016global" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> make comments on amphibian decline.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amphibian populations are currently declining across the globe <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-wake2008are" role="doc-biblioref">Wake and Vredenburg 2008</a>; <a href="references-1.html#ref-collins2009extinction" role="doc-biblioref">Collins, Crump, and Lovejoy III 2009</a>; <a href="references-1.html#ref-pimm2014biodiversity" role="doc-biblioref">Pimm et al. 2014</a>)</span> and alien amphibians are at least partially driving these declines through competition <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-kupferberg1997bullfrog" role="doc-biblioref">Kupferberg 1997</a>)</span>, hybridization <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-dufresnes2015introgressive" role="doc-biblioref">Dufresnes et al. 2015</a>)</span> and introduction of novel pathogens <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-berger1999chytrid" role="doc-biblioref">Berger, Speare, and Hyatt 1999</a>; <a href="references-1.html#ref-daszak2003infectious" role="doc-biblioref">Daszak, Cunningham, and Hyatt 2003</a>; <a href="references-1.html#ref-lamarca2005catastrophic" role="doc-biblioref">La Marca et al. 2005</a>; <a href="references-1.html#ref-martel2013batrachochytrium" role="doc-biblioref">Martel et al. 2013</a>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, it would be wrong to give a statement on amphibian decline and cite Measey et al. <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-measey2016global" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>. They did not study amphibian decline. Instead, you should read the papers that they cite <span class="citation">(e.g. <a href="references-1.html#ref-wake2008are" role="doc-biblioref">Wake and Vredenburg 2008</a>; <a href="references-1.html#ref-collins2009extinction" role="doc-biblioref">Collins, Crump, and Lovejoy III 2009</a>; <a href="references-1.html#ref-pimm2014biodiversity" role="doc-biblioref">Pimm et al. 2014</a>)</span>, and read around those to find studies on amphibian decline that are appropriate for your context. This underlines one important aspect of choosing citations where the statement that you make relates directly to the study carried out in the citation.</p>
<p>Another common mistake is to forget which paper has which information. You can try to make sure that you don’t do this by taking better notes or a more accurate plan.</p>
</div>
<div id="should-i-cite-without-reading-the-paper" class="section level2" number="12.10">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.10</span> Should I cite without reading the paper?</h2>
<p>No. When you are citing a study, you should be sufficiently familiar with the publication that you are endorsing the study in relation with the statement that you make (but see below). If you are not convinced by the nature of the study that you are tempted to cite, then rather don’t cite it and use another one. If you can’t get hold of the paper, this is another reason why you might not cite it. This is a regular reason given for why Open Access journals attract more citations.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-should-i-not-cite" class="section level2" number="12.11">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.11</span> What should I not cite?</h2>
<p>This does depend on the journal you are writing for. Some journals don’t permit citations to unpublished data or web sites. My suggestion would be to avoid such sources anyway (with particular exceptions – see below), unless it is really important that you include it. Other examples of texts to avoid are: text books (use the original paper instead), newspapers or magazines, blog posts, facebook pages (or other social media sites), predatory journals (or any non-peer reviewed article). These are all examples of <strong>grey literature</strong>.</p>
<p>There are of course exceptions. When you are writing about social media sites, or newspaper coverage, you will want to cite those sources.</p>
<p>I don’t like citations to guide-books or general text books. This has become very common, but really smacks of laziness. Most of what’s written in a guidebook has already been documented in the scientific literature, but guide-books generally don’t provide sources for the information that they provide. Thus, it’s easy to look up and find something in a guide-book, but suggests (to me) that you haven’t spent enough time or effort reviewing the literature. Some guide-books are excellent and the authors have gone to a lot of trouble to incorporate original data and observations. But this is unusual, and most data can be found in publications.</p>
<p>One exception to the not citing websites relevant to our work is the IUCN Red List. Note that all entries on this site now have DOIs, and this might be a good guide for what is available to cite. The Digital Object Identifier (<a href="doi.html">DOI</a>) is very useful as it means that there is a consistent record of that version. Otherwise, you could cite any website (even this one) and then the owner can go and change the site and it no longer says what you thought it did. The DOI removes this problem; there will always be an archived version with that particular DOI.</p>
<p>You should not cite papers that have been retracted.</p>
</div>
<div id="do-i-cite-the-review-or-the-primary-literature" class="section level2" number="12.12">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.12</span> Do I cite the review or the primary literature?</h2>
<p>The primary literature are studies or experiments that are done in order to test a hypothesis. Secondary literature includes reviews, syntheses or meta-analyses. Primacy (see below) is important, but this depends on the space you have and whether the review contains all the information you need to cite. Sometimes reviews (especially meta-analyses) provide more information. It’s preferable to use primary literature, but sometimes reviews (or meta-analyses) are actually more expedient to use, especially if they are not the focus of your study. You can even cite both when relevant.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-primacy-and-why-does-it-matter" class="section level2" number="12.13">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.13</span> What is primacy and why does it matter?</h2>
<p>Primacy in the literature is the paper/s where the authors provide the original idea or concept that you are citing. It is important in that you should give credit to original ideas over those who copy or simply repeat them, or even those who review them. Sometimes primacy is less important, especially if the concept is well known and has changed substantially. Then you should cite the most recent work that shows the ideas that you are wanting to show. Other times, primacy is important - especially when few have built on ideas or concepts since they were put forward. If in doubt place a citation to the original study and the most recent study, then flag this using a comment for your advisor to consider. The important point here is for you to give credit where it’s due and not to overlook those who put in the hard work to publish original content.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-many-citations-is-enough" class="section level2" number="12.14">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.14</span> How many citations is enough?</h2>
<p>Some journals have a word limit, or even a limit to the number of references that they allow. Others do not, and you should probably use what is recently published as a guide to what is acceptable. For the chapter of a thesis, you should err on the upper end; from 50 to 100 references. Note that citations may well be more as you may cite a paper more than once.</p>
<p>Obviously, everything you cite needs to be in the References (or <a href="references.html">Literature Cited</a>) section, and you may well need to spend time deleting extra stuff. You can get around this common issue by using a citation manager like <a href="references.html">Mendeley, Zotero or EndNote</a>. I’d always suggest that you use one of these tools as they can really help with your reading too. These days they are busy turning into a kind of scientific social network. They regularly make suggestions of what you could be reading based on what you read. This can be useful.</p>
<p>If you are looking for multiple examples of a statement that you’ve made and there are many possible, I’d suggest that you aim to produce three. Make sure that you use a suffix (like “e.g.”) to show that you are aware that these are examples of a widely reported phenomenon. You can choose these as you like, but may want to consider using what you consider to be ‘the best’ examples, and/or references that you are planning to use elsewhere in your paper/chapter. This can drive the total number down considerably, and helps to keep the citations more relevant to your work.</p>
</div>
<div id="should-i-cite-myself" class="section level2" number="12.15">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.15</span> Should I cite myself?</h2>
<p>If you are publishing relevant and appropriate papers, then there is no reason not to cite yourself. In many cases (such as with your thesis work), your own publications are likely to be more relevant to methodology and subject matter than much of the other work that is out there. However, if you’ve previously published on termite fungus and now you’re publishing on frog toes, it’s unlikely to be relevant. Choosing citations should include your comfort with being transparent. If you know when citing yourself that citing another article would be more correct in showing where an idea came from, but citing your own is more relevant to the application, then you should feel comfortable in citing both.</p>
<p>I would avoid citing your thesis if possible, rather put it all into papers. There are times though when citing your thesis is unavoidable. Within your thesis, I would suggest that you do provide citations to different chapters as this will help the examiners see how the chapters relate to each other.</p>
<p>Take a look at this article on self-citation. They claim that self-citations in the Natural Sciences run at 33% <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-vanraan2007scoping" role="doc-biblioref">Raan, Moed, and Leeuwen 2007</a>)</span>, which provides you with a nice idea of what is acceptable. Remember that this would include not only your citations to your articles, but all citations to your co-authors articles too.</p>
</div>
<div id="should-i-cite-my-friends" class="section level2" number="12.16">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.16</span> Should I cite my friends?</h2>
<p>It may be easier to cite your friends if you already know their work well. You may have heard them talk and know that the subject is relevant. They may be encouraging you to cite them, but should you?</p>
<p>In these days of scientometrics, we do need to acknowledge that citations act as a kind of currency. They count towards your H-index <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-hirsch2005index" role="doc-biblioref">Hirsch 2005</a>)</span> and this can reflect on your prospects as a postdoc or employee. What’s also clear is that cited papers get cited more, so it could really help your friends if you cite them. Obviously, the inverse is also true, so beware of the politics of citing. However, the most important points have already been raised, but will be tackled <a href="impactfactor.html">in detail later</a>. The study must be relevant and appropriate before it gets included as a citation in your work.</p>
</div>
<div id="does-the-impact-factor-of-the-cited-article-matter" class="section level2" number="12.17">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.17</span> Does the impact factor of the cited article matter?</h2>
<p>Papers in journals with high impact factors are more likely to be cited because their contents are already thought to be of interest to a wide range of people. Indeed, there is evidence that identical statements published in many journals, those with higher Impact Factors are cited more <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-perneger2010citation" role="doc-biblioref">Perneger 2010</a>)</span>. That is something that the editors of that journal will have considered even before sending the manuscript to review. Sometimes (but not always) the impact factor of the journal can be an indication of the quality of the study. But you should judge this for yourself when you critically read the paper.</p>
<p>I find that the first paragraph of a paper is more likely to contain citations of higher impact journals. This is in part as these are likely to be more cross cutting (as is often the case for the first paragraph). In the end, if you need to make a choice, choose the paper that is most relevant, irrespective of impact factor.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.22</span> Writing style</h2>
<p><strong>Did you ever feel that reading a paper was like trying to solve a puzzle?</strong></p>
<p>During my PhD I read a lot. My study species was the subject of tens of thousands of papers, and I was convinced that I’d find what I’d need somewhere in those musty old reprints and heavy volumes that came from the library shelves. It was easy to believe that the authors of those papers had set great puzzles for me to try to understand their content. The realisation that this is not the best form of communication came as a personal epiphany some years ago.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The goal of good writing is straightforward: to make your reader’s job as easy as possible”
Kevin W. Plaxco <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-plaxco2010art" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This great quote from a paper by Plaxco <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-plaxco2010art" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> cuts to the heart of why it’s essential to write well. As an editor, I once experienced an author who thought the opposite, and for me this was an epiphany. The submitted manuscript was an impenetrable mess. I could tell that there was good work in there, but as an editor I felt that the information had been made so obscure by the authors that my readers were unlikely to get much out of it. The author was a colleague, and so I decided to phone him and chat about the need for much greater clarity in his manuscript. Experience with email has taught me that they can often be taken in the wrong way; usually in the worst possible way.</p>
<p>The response I got surprised me. The author recognised that his text was dense and was unapologetic. “Let the reader work to make sense of my data,” he said. My epiphany came not because this was a totally alien concept, but because during my PhD days this was exactly how I had thought scientific writing should be done. I had spent so many hours slogging through dense and dreary papers by well-respected figures. The reward when I finally understood what it was that they were trying to communicate felt so great that I believed the puzzle they had set me was what I should set my own readers. Happily, my advisor didn’t feel the same way, but for years I continued to believe that a paper should be a decent puzzle for my readers to crack. This might seem a crazy concept, but it’s not an uncommon problem. For a great take on this in Chemistry, see this great article by Murray <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-murray2011skillful" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This has led to a general perception that “academics stink at writing” - as Steven Pinker put it. But, I think that Pinker is outdated. Certainly, as Plaxco <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-plaxco2010art" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> has it, there are a lot of ways that academics can improve their writing, for each other. But the belief that all academic writing is going to be accessible to the general public is far fetched. This is because there are a lot of terms when writing journal articles that are there for precision and brevity. These terms will exclude a larger audience, especially when they get so dense that looking them up is simply too arduous. What Plaxco <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-plaxco2010art" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> urges us to do is to make the rest of the text as accessible and easy as possible.</p>
<p>Any good writing is an artform, and that includes good academic writing. You can’t expect to be the best until you’ve spent some time at it.</p>
<p>There are still authors out there who attempt to set puzzles for their readers, but they aren’t in the mainstream any more. Instead, biological sciences has some inspiring writers, and many more are taught how to inspire future generations towards communicating great science. That’s not to say that there are no puzzles left. Much of what we do requires great puzzle solving abilities. However, let’s keep the puzzles away from communicating with our audience, make their job as reader easy or even pleasurable, and they’ll keep coming back for more.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">12.22.1</span> Don’t bamboozle</h3>
<p>It’s easy to use jargon. The whole point of jargon is to convey a (usually complex) idea in a short amount of space. Using a word (or two) instead of using several sentences clearly has some advantages. However, there is such a thing as too much jargon. Simply put, it’s unnecessary to use jargon when you can use plain English in the same amount of space. My old tutor at Liverpool University, the late, great Brian Moss, shared the following example of too much jargon <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-bump2009large" role="doc-biblioref">Bump et al. 2009</a>)</span>, when plain English would have been much shorter. Do yourself a favor and read the abstract of Bump et al <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-bump2009large" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>. The fact that it gave Moss a chance to write about moose wasn’t lost on anyone (see Figure <a href="citations.html#fig:moss">12.3</a>)!</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.23</span> When is it possible to retain your own voice when writing?</h2>
<p>Should one use “I” or “we” when writing a scientific paper? Although there was a tradition not to use first-person pronouns when writing scientific articles, this has fallen by the wayside in recent years as the use of I or we makes writing simpler for writers and readers. Use “I” if you are the sole author (or in your thesis) and “we” for two or more authors.</p>
<p>You will regularly see “I” or “we” being used in the last paragraph of the introduction and the first paragraph of the discussion. It’s also quite common to use this in the methods section. The reason why these sections have “I” or “we” is quite obvious, as it allows you to place your own voice on actions and decisions. After all, it is your aim and hypothesis for your study, so you should own it. Using first-person pronouns also allow you to be more concise, and there are some great examples here where you can see what happens when you don’t use them.</p>
<p>The first use of “I” or “we” at the end of the introduction is powerful. Up to that point, the reader has read four or five paragraphs of logical arguments outlining the background information that makes up the reasoning for your study. Using the first-person pronoun now makes the reader sit up as they have you communicating directly with them what you aimed to do. But that power is lost with repetition. So if you were to continuously use it throughout the methodology, the reader may get tired of reading a string of statements stating that you did this, then you did that, and so on. The power of using “I” or “we” is to use it sparingly to boost clarity.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">12.23.1</span> Does writing “I” or “we” help people to understand who you are?</h3>
<p>Actually, all of your writing will do this. As long as you are using your own words (and not plagiarising), your writing is likely to be unique to you and hence recognisable as you. It never ceases to amaze me that it is possible to convey the same information in so many different ways. Your way will likely change with time and experience, but remain yours throughout your writing life. If you keep writing, people will be able to recognise your distinct style.</p>

<div id="the-vonnegut-advice" class="section level3" number="12.23.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">12.23.2</span> The Vonnegut advice</h3>
<p>Kurt Vonnegut <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-vonnegut1980how" role="doc-biblioref">1980</a>)</span>, infamous novelist, provided some advice for writers. First, he made an impassioned plea for technical writers (yes, you) to use your own writing style. The easiest way, Vonnegut argues, is to write about a subject that you care about. He’s totally correct on this, and I’m hoping that after all your research you care passionately about your subject. Next, not to ramble, but to keep your writing simple.</p>
<p>What is most impressive about Vonnegut’s advice is that he argues from the readers’ standpoint. His parting advice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our audience requires us to be sympathetic and patient teachers, ever willing to simplify and clarify - whereas we would rather soar high above the crowd, singing like nightingales.”
Kurt Vonnegut</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having said that you should write about subjects that you feel passionately about, this does not mean that you should write with unsubstantiated passion. For example, it makes no sense to write: “The threats to this spectacular species surpass any mechanism known to humankind” …unless you have substantive citations or results to back this up. Yes, it’s passionate, but that should be balanced by the need to keep what you write factual.</p>

<p>It can be really tough to get started writing especially if you are writing in English as a foreign language. It could be that the academic phrasebank is just what you’re looking for.</p>
<p>When reading papers, I often come across the same phrases time and again. They seem so well honed to the situation that I’m envious about how the writer dreamt them up. Stealing them isn’t quite <a href="plagiarism.html">plagiarism</a>, but then they don’t regularly fit the exact situation that I’m looking for.</p>
<p>Imagine cutting and pasting them into a file, or even better a database that’s ready for any eventuality. Banking them over time so that they are always available.</p>
<p>Then imagine that you did this and made it available to everyone…
<a href="http://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/" class="uri">http://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/</a></p>

<p>Is it plagiarism? Given that the chapter before is all about not copying and pasting, am I now telling you that it’s ok to copy and paste? Most of these phrases are less than five words or you will find that they are non-consecutive parts of a sentence. I don’t think that most of these would constitute plagiarism if you pasted them into your document. However, I would suggest that you spend some time refining what you’ve written and that when you do that, some of these phrases may then come out.</p>

<p>Once you’ve read and revised the draft text three times yourself, and you feel that you can’t really improve it any more, hand it over. Personally, I need to wait a day or more between drafts when I work on something else, or do some reading. I find that it really helps to think about writing while not writing. Run through the arguments in your head when you are doing something else. That could be time in the gym, out running, cycling or swimming. Or talk through the logic of your argument with a friend or colleague while having coffee. You’ll find that spending time thinking away from sitting in front of your word-processor will be really valuable in promoting productivity once you sit down again.</p>
<p>If possible, hand it to an office mate or other friend first. Your reader shouldn’t have to be an expert in your field, but only needs to have a loose grasp on scientific writing to follow any paper. As a guide, any recent graduate of a biological sciences degree (BSc) should be able to understand. This makes it easy to find lots of potential readers for your manuscript before handing it in.</p>
<p><strong>In summary</strong></p>
<p>Writing a paper as a formula is not the only way of writing a scientific manuscript, but it has two really important qualities which I recommend:</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.36</span> Data Management</h2>
<p>Almost everyone has had the experience of having written some really excellent work, and then had some terrible technology malfunction meaning that they lose everything. Some failure to backup stories are truly horrific. However, they all represent a failure on the part of the person involved to properly backup their work.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, it is very easy to keep copies of documents on the cloud, or even write straight onto the cloud. Talk to your advisor about what options are available in your institution for backing up your work. Make a plan early on, before you start with your study, and then stick with that backup plan as you move through your PhD. A really good option is to start working in one of the Open Science platforms. For example, OSF allows you to create a project where you can continue to use lots of different cloud based resources, and provides an integrated home for them (for an introductory video see here). OSF is also a great platform as it is free to use, and as long as individual files are less than 5 Gb, OSF will host them. This means that for most projects, raw data files can be stored on the cloud at no cost to the project.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">12.36.1</span> Should the cloud be the only copy of your data?</h3>
<p>No. I suggest that you keep a hard drive with a copy of your data that you regularly deposit on a monthly basis, or after significant bouts of data collection such as field trips or experiments. A hard drive has the advantage that in the case of an internet outage, you always have access to your data.</p>
<p>Don’t try to store data on a laptop or desktop computer. These are for working files only. Backup is a separate operation where you store files. While computers are good for computation, they are frail and much more likely to suffer from catastrophic failures. They are also objects that are prone to being stolen.</p>

<div id="backing-up-in-the-field" class="section level3" number="12.36.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">12.36.2</span> Backing up in the field</h3>
<p>If you are going to be doing lots of field work, then you might want to make a specific plan about backing up data to the cloud during the field time. It may seem expensive, but I’m sure that it won’t be as expensive as losing the data. Alternatively, or in addition, you may want to take a portable storage option.</p>
<p>I still prefer field notes and data to be written into a book (preferably with waterproof paper such as <a href="https://www.riteintherain.com/">rite in the rain</a>). This allows you to make a photographic backup of the hard copy. Similarly, you can design datasheets that you use in the field with a pencil, and then photograph them to make a hard copy. I don’t like entering data directly into a laptop or other device. For me, the advantage is that it is too easy to mis-type a data point into a device, and then there is no record about what it should have been. These days there are multiple different ways to enter data into devices (including dictation), and so you should make your own plan about what you feel most comfortable with. If you do make a hard copy, you will then have to transcribe it later. If you make mistakes, you can go back to the hard copy.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">12.36.3</span> Make a data management plan, and stick to it</h3>
<p>However you decide to manage your data, make sure that you have a plan and that you stick to it. Don’t become a victim of some unexpected event that will lose your data. These events will still happen, but at least your existing data will be safe. Creating a secure data management plan (Figure <a href="citations.html#fig:Data-management">12.4</a>) is something that you should design and then talk through with your advisor. There is much more to data management than simply backing up your data. A great start is to read through the <a href="https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/BES-Guide-Data-Management-2019.pdf">British Ecological Society’s guide to Data Management</a>. <a href="SuppInfo.html">See part 3</a> for information about how to archive and distribute your data.</p>

<p>You probably won’t be able to think about all the potential pitfalls that may happen during your PhD, but if there are some obvious ones, then do consider them and see whether you can mitigate the circumstances should they occur.</p>
