<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 13</span> Literature databases</h1>
<p>Databases of scientific literature have been around since the 1960s when the number of journals and papers started increasing so much that scholars simply couldn’t keep up. Quite simply, you should use one or more of these databases to look for relevant literature to read. The first database, and what continues to be one of the largest, was the Science Citation Index (now renamed <a href="https://www.webofknowledge.com/">Web of Science</a>) that sought to record not only the contents of journals (titles, abstracts, authors and other metadata), but also the citations that each paper used. As we have seen in the last chapter, citations record the way in which people find the literature useful, and are therefore a highly effective way of finding related and pertinent literature in your field.</p>
<p>Before you start using a literature database, you will need to have some key literature with which you are familiar and that relates directly to your project. If you don’t have this, then check with your advisor. Often, this key literature is cited in the advert for the PhD, the grant application that funded it, or if this is a topic that your advisor has already conducted some research on, then their own publications may include part of the key literature. If you are not familiar with your advisor’s (including co-advisor’s where appropriate) papers, then a great first step is to search for them on a database and read through titles and abstracts that are relevant to your research topic. Once you have a set of key literature (this might only be 5 to 10 papers), then it is time to go to the literature databases to do your search.</p>
<div id="searching-the-literature-using-a-database" class="section level2" number="13.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.1</span> Searching the literature using a database</h2>
<p>There are two typical ways in which you can search for literature about your area of interest. The first is to use keywords and the second is to use citations of key references. I suggest that you use both of these tactics when doing your initial literature search. Further, I’d suggest that it’s worth your time keeping a record of what you have searched for, how and when and then download the results. This is called a systematic literature review. Using this tactic from the outset of your interactions with literature databases will give you a good idea of what proportion of the literature you are reading, and you might then be able to convert your finding into an objective literature review - making a great first introductory chapter for your thesis.</p>
</div>
<div id="keywords" class="section level2" number="13.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.2</span> Keywords</h2>
<p>While searching for keywords sounds easy, picking the keywords that you should use is more difficult and requires a lot of practice with the databases and your key references. Remember that keywords are often not single words, but also include short phrases. Look at all of the key references and the keywords that they contain. Any keywords that they share are going to be important for you. Most literature databases have the option of using keywords or keywords and words in the title and abstract. I would start with the broader search term and see how well they work. However, these searches alone may return such a large amount of literature that you can’t possibly read it all. In this case, you will need to use more than a single keyword. The trick is to find the correct combination of keywords that will deliver all (or most) of your key references, while not delivering returns of thousands of papers that are not relevant to your study. Ideally, you want a search term that will deliver around one hundred papers at most, where the majority have relevance to your study area. Luckily, literature databases have some tricks for you to add to combine your keywords in ways that you can include or exclude certain topics.</p>
<div id="boolean-terms-or-operators" class="section level3" number="13.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">13.2.1</span> Boolean terms or operators</h3>
<p>There are three principle Boolean operators: AND, OR and NOT.</p>
<p>You should use these to combine a string of keywords. They are relatively straightforward to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use AND when you want both terms included. For example, <em>performance AND lizards</em>. In this example, all papers that mention performance AND lizards in the title, abstract or keywords are returned.</li>
<li>Use OR when you want to include both terms. For example, <em>performance AND lizards OR geckos</em>. This example should return more literature than the previous search as it will include, all papers that mention <em>performance AND lizards OR geckos</em> in the title, abstract or keywords are returned. You will note that geckos are lizards, but people who write about geckos might not mention that they are lizards in the title, abstract or keywords, so you may need to use these extra search terms in order to pick up all of the relevant literature on lizards. If your research requires you to cover all lizards, then you might need a lot of search terms in the OR string in order to pick up all of the literature that covers lizard performance.</li>
<li>Use NOT when you specifically want to exclude a keyword. Following our example above, the search term <em>performance AND reptiles NOT snakes</em> should give you all performance papers on lizards, but you may want to exclude turtles and crocodilians as well if they have a lot of hits.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="proximity-operators-and-parentheses" class="section level3" number="13.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">13.2.2</span> Proximity operators and parentheses</h3>
<p>You can also use the term NEAR to indicate that two terms need to occur within a specified number of words. For example, performance NEAR/5 reptile will capture items where these occur within 5 words of each other, but no greater. This might be useful to exclude some papers that mention performance and reptiles in the abstract, but are not about reptile performance.
Once you start putting together search strings you will need to use brackets to make sure that the correct terms are grouped. For example, performance AND (lizards OR geckos) will get what we described above, whereas (performance AND lizards) OR geckos will give you all papers on lizards and performance plus all papers on geckos (not what we wanted).</p>
<p>Explore the advanced search options of the specific database that you are using to see the correct semantics needed for a search.</p>
</div>
<div id="wildcards" class="section level3" number="13.2.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">13.2.3</span> Wildcards</h3>
<p>Most literature databases allow you to search using different wildcards. These are *, $ and ?. These can be placed at any point within a search term and help overcome differences in spelling, or families of words that you may want to capture or exclude in your search.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use * when you want to replace a set of letters at the end of a word. For example, _reptil*_ will return all terms including Reptilia, reptile and reptiles.</li>
<li>Use ? when you want to search for any single letter at that place in a word. For example, <em>sterili?e</em> will capture words with sterilize and sterilise.</li>
<li>Use $ when there is more than a single letter that might change within a word, or the omission of a letter. For example, <em>colo$r</em> will return both US and UK spelling, color and colour, respectively.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="combining-searches" class="section level3" number="13.2.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">13.2.4</span> Combining searches</h3>
<p>Lastly, there is the option of combining searches, so that you can add search strings together or keep them apart. You will need to use the advanced search options in your database to do this.</p>
<p>You will need to carefully check your database for their precise semantics when using these Boolean operators in a search string. They are all slightly different, often using quotes around the keywords, and your search won’t work as you intend unless you are using the Boolean operators in the way the database dictates.</p>
<p>Your specific search term may end up having a long list of terms. Remember to save this whenever you make a search, especially if you refine it during your studies. Most literature databases will provide the search string that you used together with the results. Check your search string carefully for possible spelling errors that could influence your search.</p>
</div>
<div id="citations-1" class="section level3" number="13.2.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">13.2.5</span> Citations</h3>
<p>In addition to using keywords, you should search citations of your key references. Typically, when you start reviewing the literature in your specific area you will have a few key references that have been given to you by your advisor. Having read these, you will already know that they cite other works of interest, and you should follow up to look at all that seem relevant. But that’s not all, these key publications are likely to have also been cited themselves by newer papers. Tracking citations of key papers can help you keep abreast of what is happening in your field. Indeed, given the prolific ever increasing nature of scientific publications, it might be the only way to keep on top of what is happening. Some literature databases allow you to receive alerts if a paper is cited, and you should set this up for all of your key citations, and perhaps for some of the most prominent authors in your field.</p>
<p>You can’t search every paper for all the references that it cites, and its own citations. Although this would give you a solid systematic basis for your literature search, it is likely to be too much work. Getting good search terms for your keywords, and finding key references to search for citing articles is a better strategy as it makes your literature searches manageable. If you refine and save your search terms it also makes it repeatable. This will provide you with a solid basis for moving forward with your PhD, and with appropriate alerts make sure that you keep up with the latest literature in your field.</p>
<p>The above section is a brief guide, and your library is likely to have in depth guides on how to use the specific databases that they house. They may also provide training sessions, or online videos to watch. It is worth becoming familiar with exactly how the databases that you will use work, so this is time well spent at the beginning of your studies.</p>
<p>What else are literature databases used for?
The Science Citation Index used to be published as a single volume that emerged each year and was available in the reference section of the library. By the time that I started at university as an undergraduate in the 1980s, it was several volumes large and my first task for my tutor (one Dr Dave Thompson) was to look up all of his citations. Within a couple of years, the database was digitised and available on CD, and eventually became accessible through the internet.</p>
<p>Clearly, the Science Citation Index cost some money to put together, and universities paid annually to receive the books, and then the CDs and finally to access the online versions. They were not for profit organisations, but eventually they were bought out by the evil profit making parasites of science. Yes, publishers saw the dependency that scientists have on a resource and decided to own it for themselves and then radically increase the price to access it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="administrators-want-metrics" class="section level2" number="13.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.3</span> Administrators want metrics</h2>
<p>But it wasn’t just scientists that were interested in the databases of literature. Administrators became interested in the metrics that the databases produced on academics so that they could use them as a measure of performance, or potential in the case of hiring academics. The obsession with simplifying metrics by administrators who don’t understand the work that their academics produce, has driven the importance and proliferations of literature databases. However, it is widely acknowledged that the way in which journal metrics are used is unhealthy, and this has led to the <a href="https://sfdora.org/read/%5D%20(known%20as%20DORA)">San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment</a>.</p>
<p>In the life sciences, there are three prominent databases used: Google Scholar, Web of Science (owned by Clarivate Analytics aka Thomson Reuters) and Scopus (owned by Elsevier). But new players are entering the market all the time, and two of the newest are Dimensions from Digital Science and Microsoft Academic.</p>
</div>
<div id="google-scholar-web-of-science-or-scopus" class="section level2" number="13.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.4</span> Google Scholar, Web of Science or Scopus?</h2>
<p>Have you ever wondered why Google Scholar (GS) scores are so inflated compared to other citation databases like Web of Science (WoS) or Scopus? I’ve always noticed that Scopus has better coverage than WoS, and that GS is bigger than both (and a lot messier with lots of weird duplicates and poorly entered stuff), but is there anything more to it than that?</p>
<p>Well it seems that there are some people who have already thought about this, and come up with a good idea of exactly what’s different. Martín-Martín et al <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-martin-martin2018google" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> have done a great job of analysing all this stuff from some 2.5 million citations. What they found inspired me to write this chapter, in which I’ve focussed on the results from the Life-Sciences. But I encourage you to go read the article for yourself.</p>
<p>I have been known to take the odd peak at my Google Scholar profile over the year, and see how it’s coming along. I rarely check on WoS or Scopus, ’cos it’s a bit of a faff getting signed in and doing the search. Plus it looks so much smaller when one is habituated to seeing those double digits in GS! However, I’ve always been a bit uneasy about citing my GS citation rate, H-index or i10 (among others that they give) as I’ve never really known what all that extra represents. Something grey and unseemly? Well, it turns out that it’s all good stuff, and perhaps GS is the better one to cite as it’s a more inclusive index: more inclusive of different document types and different languages.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that of the three indices, Google Scholar seems to be the easiest to manipulate. Delgado López‐Cózar et al <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-delgadolopez-cozar2014google" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> show how it is possible to manipulate citations and therefore metrics of individual researchers by depositing false documents into institutional repositories (note that they did this as an experiment, and you may find that restrictions on doing this at your own institution are prohibitive or lax). The authors also note that a consistent problem with Google Scholar is the lack of transparency, and therefore verification, of how the bibliometrics are calculated. This will make a difference to what papers are found, as Google Scholar tends to report those with the greatest citations first on the first page of outputs. Hence once a paper is initially boosted by manipulation, it will be more likely to be found and increasingly cited.</p>
<p>To directly compare your citation metrics from different platforms, and also to get more unbiased metrics than these platforms provide, consider using the software Publish or Perish <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-harzing2007publish" role="doc-biblioref">Harzing 2007</a>)</span>. This also provides a great platform on which to harvest data from Google Scholar into a database, or put it directly into another database, like EndNote, Zotero or Mendelay.</p>
</div>
<div id="whats-the-difference-between-indices" class="section level2" number="13.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.5</span> What’s the difference between indices?</h2>
<p>Martín-Martín et al <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-martin-martin2018google" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> allows you to interpret your GS results as a more inclusive citation index. While WoS and Scopus aren’t exclusively English or journal publications, they are mostly. But that extra third that GS gives you allows you to show the extra scope that your work is getting outside that English journal mainstream. Is your GS score more than a third higher than your WoS or Scopus score? If yes, then your work is having a greater impact elsewhere in the world, and there’s nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>The excerpts from the two tables above show how well GS correlates with both WoS and Scopus in our area (Biological Sciences). It also tells you by how much the GS score is likely to be inflated - 1.90 for GS/WoS and 1.45 for GS/Scopus. Again, if you deviate from this with a higher score, you can give yourself a pat on the back for having work that’s reaching more people in more parts of the world.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.9</span> Writing style</h2>
<p><strong>Did you ever feel that reading a paper was like trying to solve a puzzle?</strong></p>
<p>During my PhD I read a lot. My study species was the subject of tens of thousands of papers, and I was convinced that I’d find what I’d need somewhere in those musty old reprints and heavy volumes that came from the library shelves. It was easy to believe that the authors of those papers had set great puzzles for me to try to understand their content. The realisation that this is not the best form of communication came as a personal epiphany some years ago.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The goal of good writing is straightforward: to make your reader’s job as easy as possible”
Kevin W. Plaxco <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-plaxco2010art" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This great quote from a paper by Plaxco <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-plaxco2010art" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> cuts to the heart of why it’s essential to write well. As an editor, I once experienced an author who thought the opposite, and for me this was an epiphany. The submitted manuscript was an impenetrable mess. I could tell that there was good work in there, but as an editor I felt that the information had been made so obscure by the authors that my readers were unlikely to get much out of it. The author was a colleague, and so I decided to phone him and chat about the need for much greater clarity in his manuscript. Experience with email has taught me that they can often be taken in the wrong way; usually in the worst possible way.</p>
<p>The response I got surprised me. The author recognised that his text was dense and was unapologetic. “Let the reader work to make sense of my data,” he said. My epiphany came not because this was a totally alien concept, but because during my PhD days this was exactly how I had thought scientific writing should be done. I had spent so many hours slogging through dense and dreary papers by well-respected figures. The reward when I finally understood what it was that they were trying to communicate felt so great that I believed the puzzle they had set me was what I should set my own readers. Happily, my advisor didn’t feel the same way, but for years I continued to believe that a paper should be a decent puzzle for my readers to crack. This might seem a crazy concept, but it’s not an uncommon problem. For a great take on this in Chemistry, see this great article by Murray <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-murray2011skillful" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This has led to a general perception that “academics stink at writing” - as Steven Pinker put it. But, I think that Pinker is outdated. Certainly, as Plaxco <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-plaxco2010art" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> has it, there are a lot of ways that academics can improve their writing, for each other. But the belief that all academic writing is going to be accessible to the general public is far fetched. This is because there are a lot of terms when writing journal articles that are there for precision and brevity. These terms will exclude a larger audience, especially when they get so dense that looking them up is simply too arduous. What Plaxco <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-plaxco2010art" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> urges us to do is to make the rest of the text as accessible and easy as possible.</p>
<p>Any good writing is an artform, and that includes good academic writing. You can’t expect to be the best until you’ve spent some time at it.</p>
<p>There are still authors out there who attempt to set puzzles for their readers, but they aren’t in the mainstream any more. Instead, biological sciences has some inspiring writers, and many more are taught how to inspire future generations towards communicating great science. That’s not to say that there are no puzzles left. Much of what we do requires great puzzle solving abilities. However, let’s keep the puzzles away from communicating with our audience, make their job as reader easy or even pleasurable, and they’ll keep coming back for more.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">13.9.1</span> Don’t bamboozle</h3>
<p>It’s easy to use jargon. The whole point of jargon is to convey a (usually complex) idea in a short amount of space. Using a word (or two) instead of using several sentences clearly has some advantages. However, there is such a thing as too much jargon. Simply put, it’s unnecessary to use jargon when you can use plain English in the same amount of space. My old tutor at Liverpool University, the late, great Brian Moss, shared the following example of too much jargon <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-bump2009large" role="doc-biblioref">Bump et al. 2009</a>)</span>, when plain English would have been much shorter. Do yourself a favor and read the abstract of Bump et al <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-bump2009large" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>. The fact that it gave Moss a chance to write about moose wasn’t lost on anyone (see Figure <a href="databases.html#fig:moss">13.1</a>)!</p>

<div id="voice" class="section level2" number="13.10">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.10</span> When is it possible to retain your own voice when writing?</h2>
<p>Should one use “I” or “we” when writing a scientific paper? Although there was a tradition not to use first-person pronouns when writing scientific articles, this has fallen by the wayside in recent years as the use of I or we makes writing simpler for writers and readers. Use “I” if you are the sole author (or in your thesis) and “we” for two or more authors.</p>
<p>You will regularly see “I” or “we” being used in the last paragraph of the introduction and the first paragraph of the discussion. It’s also quite common to use this in the methods section. The reason why these sections have “I” or “we” is quite obvious, as it allows you to place your own voice on actions and decisions. After all, it is your aim and hypothesis for your study, so you should own it. Using first-person pronouns also allow you to be more concise, and there are some great examples here where you can see what happens when you don’t use them.</p>
<p>The first use of “I” or “we” at the end of the introduction is powerful. Up to that point, the reader has read four or five paragraphs of logical arguments outlining the background information that makes up the reasoning for your study. Using the first-person pronoun now makes the reader sit up as they have you communicating directly with them what you aimed to do. But that power is lost with repetition. So if you were to continuously use it throughout the methodology, the reader may get tired of reading a string of statements stating that you did this, then you did that, and so on. The power of using “I” or “we” is to use it sparingly to boost clarity.</p>
<div id="does-writing-i-or-we-help-people-to-understand-who-you-are" class="section level3" number="13.10.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">13.10.1</span> Does writing “I” or “we” help people to understand who you are?</h3>
<p>Actually, all of your writing will do this. As long as you are using your own words (and not plagiarising), your writing is likely to be unique to you and hence recognisable as you. It never ceases to amaze me that it is possible to convey the same information in so many different ways. Your way will likely change with time and experience, but remain yours throughout your writing life. If you keep writing, people will be able to recognise your distinct style.</p>

<div id="the-vonnegut-advice" class="section level3" number="13.10.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">13.10.2</span> The Vonnegut advice</h3>
<p>Kurt Vonnegut <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-vonnegut1980how" role="doc-biblioref">1980</a>)</span>, infamous novelist, provided some advice for writers. First, he made an impassioned plea for technical writers (yes, you) to use your own writing style. The easiest way, Vonnegut argues, is to write about a subject that you care about. He’s totally correct on this, and I’m hoping that after all your research you care passionately about your subject. Next, not to ramble, but to keep your writing simple.</p>
<p>What is most impressive about Vonnegut’s advice is that he argues from the readers’ standpoint. His parting advice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our audience requires us to be sympathetic and patient teachers, ever willing to simplify and clarify - whereas we would rather soar high above the crowd, singing like nightingales.”
Kurt Vonnegut</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having said that you should write about subjects that you feel passionately about, this does not mean that you should write with unsubstantiated passion. For example, it makes no sense to write: “The threats to this spectacular species surpass any mechanism known to humankind” …unless you have substantive citations or results to back this up. Yes, it’s passionate, but that should be balanced by the need to keep what you write factual.</p>

<p>When reading papers, I often come across the same phrases time and again. They seem so well honed to the situation that I’m envious about how the writer dreamt them up. Stealing them isn’t quite <a href="plagiarism.html">plagiarism</a>, but then they don’t regularly fit the exact situation that I’m looking for.</p>
<p>Imagine cutting and pasting them into a file, or even better a database that’s ready for any eventuality. Banking them over time so that they are always available.</p>
<p>Then imagine that you did this and made it available to everyone…

<p>Is it plagiarism? Given that the chapter before is all about not copying and pasting, am I now telling you that it’s ok to copy and paste? Most of these phrases are less than five words or you will find that they are non-consecutive parts of a sentence. I don’t think that most of these would constitute plagiarism if you pasted them into your document. However, I would suggest that you spend some time refining what you’ve written and that when you do that, some of these phrases may then come out.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.22</span> When is it good enough to submit to my advisor?</h2>
<p>Once you’ve read and revised the draft text three times yourself, and you feel that you can’t really improve it any more, hand it over. Personally, I need to wait a day or more between drafts when I work on something else, or do some reading. I find that it really helps to think about writing while not writing. Run through the arguments in your head when you are doing something else. That could be time in the gym, out running, cycling or swimming. Or talk through the logic of your argument with a friend or colleague while having coffee. You’ll find that spending time thinking away from sitting in front of your word-processor will be really valuable in promoting productivity once you sit down again.</p>
<p>If possible, hand it to an office mate or other friend first. Your reader shouldn’t have to be an expert in your field, but only needs to have a loose grasp on scientific writing to follow any paper. As a guide, any recent graduate of a biological sciences degree (BSc) should be able to understand. This makes it easy to find lots of potential readers for your manuscript before handing it in.</p>
<p><strong>In summary</strong></p>
<p>Writing a paper as a formula is not the only way of writing a scientific manuscript, but it has two really important qualities which I recommend:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>it makes writing easier, and</li>
<li>readers will be familiar with the style and this will help them understand your work.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.23</span> Data Management</h2>
<p>Almost everyone has had the experience of having written some really excellent work, and then had some terrible technology malfunction meaning that they lose everything. Some failure to backup stories are truly horrific. However, they all represent a failure on the part of the person involved to properly backup their work.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, it is very easy to keep copies of documents on the cloud, or even write straight onto the cloud. Talk to your advisor about what options are available in your institution for backing up your work. Make a plan early on, before you start with your study, and then stick with that backup plan as you move through your PhD. A really good option is to start working in one of the Open Science platforms. For example, OSF allows you to create a project where you can continue to use lots of different cloud based resources, and provides an integrated home for them (for an introductory video see here). OSF is also a great platform as it is free to use, and as long as individual files are less than 5 Gb, OSF will host them. This means that for most projects, raw data files can be stored on the cloud at no cost to the project.</p>
<div id="should-the-cloud-be-the-only-copy-of-your-data" class="section level3" number="13.23.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">13.23.1</span> Should the cloud be the only copy of your data?</h3>
<p>No. I suggest that you keep a hard drive with a copy of your data that you regularly deposit on a monthly basis, or after significant bouts of data collection such as field trips or experiments. A hard drive has the advantage that in the case of an internet outage, you always have access to your data.</p>
<p>Don’t try to store data on a laptop or desktop computer. These are for working files only. Backup is a separate operation where you store files. While computers are good for computation, they are frail and much more likely to suffer from catastrophic failures. They are also objects that are prone to being stolen.</p>
</div>
<div id="backing-up-in-the-field" class="section level3" number="13.23.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">13.23.2</span> Backing up in the field</h3>
<p>If you are going to be doing lots of field work, then you might want to make a specific plan about backing up data to the cloud during the field time. It may seem expensive, but I’m sure that it won’t be as expensive as losing the data. Alternatively, or in addition, you may want to take a portable storage option.</p>
<p>I still prefer field notes and data to be written into a book (preferably with waterproof paper such as <a href="https://www.riteintherain.com/">rite in the rain</a>). This allows you to make a photographic backup of the hard copy. Similarly, you can design datasheets that you use in the field with a pencil, and then photograph them to make a hard copy. I don’t like entering data directly into a laptop or other device. For me, the advantage is that it is too easy to mis-type a data point into a device, and then there is no record about what it should have been. These days there are multiple different ways to enter data into devices (including dictation), and so you should make your own plan about what you feel most comfortable with. If you do make a hard copy, you will then have to transcribe it later. If you make mistakes, you can go back to the hard copy.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">13.23.3</span> Make a data management plan, and stick to it</h3>
<p>However you decide to manage your data, make sure that you have a plan and that you stick to it. Don’t become a victim of some unexpected event that will lose your data. These events will still happen, but at least your existing data will be safe. Creating a secure data management plan (Figure <a href="databases.html#fig:Data-management">13.2</a>) is something that you should design and then talk through with your advisor. There is much more to data management than simply backing up your data. A great start is to read through the <a href="https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/BES-Guide-Data-Management-2019.pdf">British Ecological Society’s guide to Data Management</a>. <a href="SuppInfo.html">See part 3</a> for information about how to archive and distribute your data.</p>

<p>You probably won’t be able to think about all the potential pitfalls that may happen during your PhD, but if there are some obvious ones, then do consider them and see whether you can mitigate the circumstances should they occur.</p>
