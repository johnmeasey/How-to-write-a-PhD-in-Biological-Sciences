<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 9</span> Writing a paragraph</h1>
<p>In the following chapters, I will explain how to write a scientific paper in a formulaic style, as well as the advantages that this has over starting from scratch each time. The suggestion is that once, you sketch out your paper in a ‘bullet-point’ outline. This outline will give you an idea of the subject in each paragraph, as well as how the paragraphs fit in with each other. The other suggestion was to flesh out this outline by assigning relevant citations to help you remember those main ideas.</p>
<p>Writing paragraphs has a skill all of its own, and the aim of this chapter is to go over the basics of how to put a paragraph together. Other people have also written about this, and you can read an example here.</p>
<p><strong>This paragraph starts with a topic sentence which contains the principle idea that citations are needed for examples.</strong> The following sentences put this idea into the context of your study. This should be based on examples from existing literature with the corresponding in-text citations provided (Smith et al 2017; Jones 2018). You can use examples in your paragraph to make your point. For examples, Smith and Jones (2017) carried out a study that showed that examples without citations have no credibility for readers. And this was backed up by another study by Jones and Smith (2018), which provided further evidence for the need to provide examples. Once you’ve provided your evidence, and introduced any covariates that you need to, like the use of literature for examples, then you are ready to sum up and link. <em>After reading this paragraph, the reader will know why citations are needed for examples, and they’ll be ready to read more about the topic of writing a paragraph in more detail.</em></p>
<p>In the paragraph above, the topic sentence is bold, the supporting sentences are normal font, and the clincher is in italics.</p>
<div id="topic-sentence" class="section level2" number="9.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.1</span> Topic sentence</h2>
<p>A topic sentence allows the reader to understand quickly the idea/topic you are putting forward in the paragraph. It must be in the context in which you are going to develop the same topic. There’s no point in just mentioning a topic in passing or using it in a different way than you will later.</p>
<p>Make your topic sentence relatively simple. Don’t be tempted to add multiple clauses. If the topic sentence is too complex, you’ll lose your reader right at the beginning of the paragraph.</p>
</div>
<div id="supporting-sentences" class="section level2" number="9.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.2</span> Supporting sentences</h2>
<p>Supporting sentences convey all the relevant information to the reader. They are going to be statements that are well cited, showing readers where the original ideas came from. Be sure to keep these sentences on topic, and regularly refer back to your outline to make sure that you keep to the original objective of the paragraph. These are the meat of the paragraph and it’s really important to get them right.</p>
<p>If you are writing about differences, then state which way the difference is. For example, if bullfrogs are larger than leaf litter frogs, then say this. Telling your audience that something is different than something else only ends up leaving them guessing about the way in which the things are different. There’s no point in drip dripping this information through. Set it down in as little space as possible so that your reader doesn’t get bored.</p>
<p>Sentences within the meat of the paragraph interact, and there’s a great example to show how this is done here. These interactions usually dwell around pertinent variables (such as those that you are going to deal with in your paper). By using the same or similar words within the paragraph, you are able to demonstrate to the reader how those different points interact.</p>
<p>While repeating the names of the variables, or their abbreviations, can be helpful, repeating descriptive words becomes quite tedious to the reader. Repeatedly reading the same ideas repeated over and over quickly bores the reader. Bored readers are less likely to take in what you write, even if you are repeating the same information (yes, I’m repeating myself - boring isn’t it). It will also give the reader the impression that your vocabulary is very limited. These days you can do a quick right click on a highlighted word to get a drop down list of synonyms (Figure <a href="paragraph.html#fig:synonym">9.1</a>). This can allow you to go back and replace your repeated word with: recurrent, frequent, recurring, repetitive, constant or continual. That’s more than enough to spice up the paragraph. However, if you’re not sure whether a word is correctly replacing another, ask a friend to read it.</p>

<p>Your supporting sentences are best built in the formula of an <a href="argument.html">argument</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-magic-of-threes" class="section level2" number="9.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.3</span> The magic of threes</h2>
<p>We can learn a lot about writing convincingly in science by borrowing from storytelling, and one of the greatest lessons in storytelling involves the magic of threes <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-angler2020telling" role="doc-biblioref">Angler 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In putting together your paragraph you can use the magic of threes to break your dialogue into three parts: thesis, antithesis and synthesis (a, b and a+b). Think of it this way: there’s a standard explanation of how a phenomenon that you want to investigate interacts with the variable of your choice (thesis). Then there’s some contradictory evidence that suggests that the standard explanation is not necessarily correct (antithesis). Lastly, there is your approach to investigate exactly how the variable and phenomenon interact which should explain (or at least advance our understanding) of how the variable and the phenomenon are related (synthesis). It may be that this construct should be fleshed out into three paragraphs instead of three sentences within a paragraph.</p>
<p>You won’t be able to construct every paragraph with the magic of threes, but once you have learned this rule, you’ll be able to use it to help emphasise important points in your manuscript that you want the reader to remember as they move forwards. What if your list is two instead of three? Well then you’ll lose the magic, but maybe you can think it through it again? If you have two, then you normally have three by means of the combination of the two (a, b and a+b).</p>
<p>What follows is more advice about telling a good story: using an example and avoiding being boring: i.e. replacing those long lists with a maximum of three items.</p>
</div>
<div id="use-an-example" class="section level2" number="9.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.4</span> Use an example</h2>
<p>Examples are a very powerful way of conveying ideas in a short amount of space. Don’t replace your paragraph with an example, but do use an example if it shows the reader just what you want. You should be able to do this in a sentence (or two), but if you’re tempted to go on, it’s probably not a good example. Because the first paragraph sets out ideas, it’s unlikely that an example there will be a good idea.</p>
</div>
<div id="avoid-lists" class="section level2" number="9.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.5</span> Avoid lists</h2>
<p>I’m not a big fan of paragraphs which are simply a long list with little or no thought offered. The worst ones are where there are so many citations along the way that it’s really hard to pick out what is a sentence and what is citation. I understand that it’s important to show precedent and that there is merit in showing how widespread an idea is over taxa or in different disciplines. You never find these lists in journals where words and/or citations are limited, which suggests that you can dispense with them.</p>
<p>Instead, you can avoid long lists by pulling them into themes. Once you’ve managed to get three themes, you’ll find that you can work them into your paper time and again. For example, each theme might well be worth a separate paragraph or section in the discussion.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-last-sentence-of-the-paragraph-the-clincher" class="section level2" number="9.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.6</span> The last sentence of the paragraph: the clincher</h2>
<p>Once you’ve conveyed all of the information that you planned to impart in your outline, it’s time for the last sentence. This should conclude the evidence that you’ve provided on your topic. Try not to make it lame. For example: “This shows that little work has been done.” One of my pet hates is authors who insist on telling us that “little work has been done,” as if this was a justification for doing anything. Instead, make it a real clincher about why the topic is important, or how and why you will tackle it. Instead (or as well if you can), you may want this sentence to link on to another paragraph (topic), especially if flow is important at that part of your outline (see below). If you have just constructed a paragraph with thesis, antithesis and synthesis, then your clincher might be simply to underline that your approach in the paper is to investigate the synthesis. Either way, make sure that your last sentence is on topic, and one that sticks in the readers’ minds.</p>
</div>
<div id="above-all---read-it" class="section level2" number="9.7">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.7</span> Above all - read it!</h2>
<p>Your paragraph is not finished until you’ve read it. Reading is an essential part to writing that cannot be emphasised enough. Does your paragraph say what you planned in your outline? If your paragraph and any other text doesn’t make sense to you, it sure won’t impress anyone else. If you can’t bear to read it through immediately, then do it after you’ve written two or three paragraphs. I suggest that you don’t wait until you’ve finished the manuscript. Rather get the text right as you go along.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-does-the-paragraph-fit-into-the-flow" class="section level2" number="9.8">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.8</span> How does the paragraph fit into the flow?</h2>
<p>So now we’ve gone over the formula, it’s time to take a step back and look again at the paragraph in the context of your outline. Remember that the paragraph represents a single subject, but that it is still just part of the manuscript as a whole and you need that to flow from beginning to end. This means that it’s not enough to write each paragraph in isolation, but to think of the way in which they link together as a whole, especially when you are trying to make a logical argument.</p>
<p>You might get a comment from me about missing logic in the argument or a lack of flow in a paragraph. This usually comes from not having a good outline (see below). You should be using the outline to provide the logic in the flow of your argument, flesh it out with the relevant references. If you already know this well, then writing the paragraph will just be a question of styling the outline. Remember that there is a purpose to your paragraph. You have an argument to make the reader understand. Don’t be tempted to include information that is distracting or moving away from the flow of that argument.</p>
<p>I am very fond of ending a paragraph on a linking sentence. Essentially, this shows how two ideas are connected in the last sentence. This really helps with getting the flow of an introduction or discussion, but linking sentences are not always the best way to end a paragraph. Sometimes there’s no option but to change the subject completely, and then you should go for the clincher idea (see above). For example, you may want to end the paragraph by seeding a new twist on the paragraph’s idea.</p>
</div>
<div id="seeding-ideas" class="section level2" number="9.9">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.9</span> Seeding ideas</h2>
<p>The introduction sets out the established literature in order to put your study in context, but your discussion provides you with an opportunity to present new ideas, or to turn and twist existing ideas in a new way. Once you’ve got a good idea what these are, I like to seed the introduction with hints as to what these might be. Sowing seeds early in a manuscript will provide the reader with hints as to where you are going. Writing these seeds as questions is a really good way of sowing them into an introduction. You can then go on to answer them (if only partly) in the discussion. Beware though, there’s no point in asking a major question in the introduction to which your data has no relevance!</p>
</div>
<div id="breaking-the-rules" class="section level2" number="9.10">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.10</span> Breaking the rules</h2>
<p>Just as in the other instructions on formulaic paper writing, when writing a paragraph you shouldn’t feel totally constrained so that you can’t break the rules. Breaking the rules can set you free, and much of what you read that really stands out will do this. However, it’s much easier to break the rules and get it wrong, than break them and get it right. The idea of this chapter was to help you get started, not to communicate with those who are already writing great stuff. So if you’re already great, don’t break it by doing any of this!</p>
</div>
<div id="some-common-paragraph-mistakes" class="section level2" number="9.11">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.11</span> Some common paragraph mistakes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don’t start your paragraph by linking back to the previous point. Start with your new topic sentence. If you aren’t ready to change the topic, you aren’t ready for a new paragraph.</li>
<li>Don’t start the paragraph with an unsubstantiated or over-inflated claim (keep it calm and within the bounds of what you are citing). Similarly, don’t start with a trivial caveat. And don’t start with a list or long string of citations.</li>
<li>Don’t let your paragraph get too long. It is said that 250 words is the threshold. If you haven’t covered what you wanted to in your outline within 250 words, then you need to rethink your outline for that paragraph! Definitely don’t split a paragraph that’s too long into two!</li>
<li>If you started without an outline, it’s never too late to go back and write an outline. Simply write down what you are trying to say (as a set of bullet points), and why (see below for an example).</li>
<li>Your paragraph should have more than one citation in it. If you find yourself citing the same paper several times in the same paragraph, then there’s something wrong with your outline, and the way that you are reading and citing papers (see below). Remember that what you write is about making your own argument from the literature, and not copying others arguments.</li>
</ul>
<p>The English grammar rules apply when writing science. I can’t go into these in detail here as they are legion and complex. However, here are a few mistakes that are often made by those writing in science:</p>
<ul>
<li>You should not start a sentence with an abbreviated genus. Instead write the genus name in full.</li>
<li>You should not start a sentence with a numeral. If you have to use the number as the first word, write it out. Otherwise, rearrange your sentence.</li>
<li>Make sure that acronyms are spelt out on first use (this may be needed for each section)</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.19</span> Writing style</h2>
<p><strong>Did you ever feel that reading a paper was like trying to solve a puzzle?</strong></p>
<p>During my PhD I read a lot. My study species was the subject of tens of thousands of papers, and I was convinced that I’d find what I’d need somewhere in those musty old reprints and heavy volumes that came from the library shelves. It was easy to believe that the authors of those papers had set great puzzles for me to try to understand their content. The realisation that this is not the best form of communication came as a personal epiphany some years ago.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The goal of good writing is straightforward: to make your reader’s job as easy as possible”
Kevin W. Plaxco <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-plaxco2010art" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This great quote from a paper by Plaxco <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-plaxco2010art" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> cuts to the heart of why it’s essential to write well. As an editor, I once experienced an author who thought the opposite, and for me this was an epiphany. The submitted manuscript was an impenetrable mess. I could tell that there was good work in there, but as an editor I felt that the information had been made so obscure by the authors that my readers were unlikely to get much out of it. The author was a colleague, and so I decided to phone him and chat about the need for much greater clarity in his manuscript. Experience with email has taught me that they can often be taken in the wrong way; usually in the worst possible way.</p>
<p>The response I got surprised me. The author recognised that his text was dense and was unapologetic. “Let the reader work to make sense of my data,” he said. My epiphany came not because this was a totally alien concept, but because during my PhD days this was exactly how I had thought scientific writing should be done. I had spent so many hours slogging through dense and dreary papers by well-respected figures. The reward when I finally understood what it was that they were trying to communicate felt so great that I believed the puzzle they had set me was what I should set my own readers. Happily, my advisor didn’t feel the same way, but for years I continued to believe that a paper should be a decent puzzle for my readers to crack. This might seem a crazy concept, but it’s not an uncommon problem. For a great take on this in Chemistry, see this great article by Murray <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-murray2011skillful" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This has led to a general perception that “academics stink at writing” - as Steven Pinker put it. But, I think that Pinker is outdated. Certainly, as Plaxco <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-plaxco2010art" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> has it, there are a lot of ways that academics can improve their writing, for each other. But the belief that all academic writing is going to be accessible to the general public is far fetched. This is because there are a lot of terms when writing journal articles that are there for precision and brevity. These terms will exclude a larger audience, especially when they get so dense that looking them up is simply too arduous. What Plaxco <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-plaxco2010art" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> urges us to do is to make the rest of the text as accessible and easy as possible.</p>
<p>Any good writing is an artform, and that includes good academic writing. You can’t expect to be the best until you’ve spent some time at it.</p>
<p>There are still authors out there who attempt to set puzzles for their readers, but they aren’t in the mainstream any more. Instead, biological sciences has some inspiring writers, and many more are taught how to inspire future generations towards communicating great science. That’s not to say that there are no puzzles left. Much of what we do requires great puzzle solving abilities. However, let’s keep the puzzles away from communicating with our audience, make their job as reader easy or even pleasurable, and they’ll keep coming back for more.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.19.1</span> Don’t bamboozle</h3>
<p>It’s easy to use jargon. The whole point of jargon is to convey a (usually complex) idea in a short amount of space. Using a word (or two) instead of using several sentences clearly has some advantages. However, there is such a thing as too much jargon. Simply put, it’s unnecessary to use jargon when you can use plain English in the same amount of space. My old tutor at Liverpool University, the late, great Brian Moss, shared the following example of too much jargon <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-bump2009large" role="doc-biblioref">Bump et al. 2009</a>)</span>, when plain English would have been much shorter. Do yourself a favor and read the abstract of Bump et al <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-bump2009large" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>. The fact that it gave Moss a chance to write about moose wasn’t lost on anyone (see Figure <a href="paragraph.html#fig:moss">9.2</a>)!</p>

<div id="voice" class="section level2" number="9.20">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.20</span> When is it possible to retain your own voice when writing?</h2>
<p>Should one use “I” or “we” when writing a scientific paper? Although there was a tradition not to use first-person pronouns when writing scientific articles, this has fallen by the wayside in recent years as the use of I or we makes writing simpler for writers and readers. Use “I” if you are the sole author (or in your thesis) and “we” for two or more authors.</p>
<p>You will regularly see “I” or “we” being used in the last paragraph of the introduction and the first paragraph of the discussion. It’s also quite common to use this in the methods section. The reason why these sections have “I” or “we” is quite obvious, as it allows you to place your own voice on actions and decisions. After all, it is your aim and hypothesis for your study, so you should own it. Using first-person pronouns also allow you to be more concise, and there are some great examples here where you can see what happens when you don’t use them.</p>
<p>The first use of “I” or “we” at the end of the introduction is powerful. Up to that point, the reader has read four or five paragraphs of logical arguments outlining the background information that makes up the reasoning for your study. Using the first-person pronoun now makes the reader sit up as they have you communicating directly with them what you aimed to do. But that power is lost with repetition. So if you were to continuously use it throughout the methodology, the reader may get tired of reading a string of statements stating that you did this, then you did that, and so on. The power of using “I” or “we” is to use it sparingly to boost clarity.</p>
<div id="does-writing-i-or-we-help-people-to-understand-who-you-are" class="section level3" number="9.20.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.20.1</span> Does writing “I” or “we” help people to understand who you are?</h3>
<p>Actually, all of your writing will do this. As long as you are using your own words (and not plagiarising), your writing is likely to be unique to you and hence recognisable as you. It never ceases to amaze me that it is possible to convey the same information in so many different ways. Your way will likely change with time and experience, but remain yours throughout your writing life. If you keep writing, people will be able to recognise your distinct style.</p>

<div id="the-vonnegut-advice" class="section level3" number="9.20.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.20.2</span> The Vonnegut advice</h3>
<p>Kurt Vonnegut <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-vonnegut1980how" role="doc-biblioref">1980</a>)</span>, infamous novelist, provided some advice for writers. First, he made an impassioned plea for technical writers (yes, you) to use your own writing style. The easiest way, Vonnegut argues, is to write about a subject that you care about. He’s totally correct on this, and I’m hoping that after all your research you care passionately about your subject. Next, not to ramble, but to keep your writing simple.</p>
<p>What is most impressive about Vonnegut’s advice is that he argues from the readers’ standpoint. His parting advice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our audience requires us to be sympathetic and patient teachers, ever willing to simplify and clarify - whereas we would rather soar high above the crowd, singing like nightingales.”
Kurt Vonnegut</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having said that you should write about subjects that you feel passionately about, this does not mean that you should write with unsubstantiated passion. For example, it makes no sense to write: “The threats to this spectacular species surpass any mechanism known to humankind” …unless you have substantive citations or results to back this up. Yes, it’s passionate, but that should be balanced by the need to keep what you write factual.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.24.2</span> Getting started</h3>
<p>It strikes me that this is going to be a fantastic resource for those of you who are not writing in English as your home language. And for those of you who just need a few words to get started. It’ll also be useful when you are wanting to wordsmith your introduction or abstract.</p>
<p>Is it plagiarism? Given that the chapter before is all about not copying and pasting, am I now telling you that it’s ok to copy and paste? Most of these phrases are less than five words or you will find that they are non-consecutive parts of a sentence. I don’t think that most of these would constitute plagiarism if you pasted them into your document. However, I would suggest that you spend some time refining what you’ve written and that when you do that, some of these phrases may then come out.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.32</span> When is it good enough to submit to my advisor?</h2>
<p>Once you’ve read and revised the draft text three times yourself, and you feel that you can’t really improve it any more, hand it over. Personally, I need to wait a day or more between drafts when I work on something else, or do some reading. I find that it really helps to think about writing while not writing. Run through the arguments in your head when you are doing something else. That could be time in the gym, out running, cycling or swimming. Or talk through the logic of your argument with a friend or colleague while having coffee. You’ll find that spending time thinking away from sitting in front of your word-processor will be really valuable in promoting productivity once you sit down again.</p>
<p>If possible, hand it to an office mate or other friend first. Your reader shouldn’t have to be an expert in your field, but only needs to have a loose grasp on scientific writing to follow any paper. As a guide, any recent graduate of a biological sciences degree (BSc) should be able to understand. This makes it easy to find lots of potential readers for your manuscript before handing it in.</p>
<p><strong>In summary</strong></p>
<p>Writing a paper as a formula is not the only way of writing a scientific manuscript, but it has two really important qualities which I recommend:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>it makes writing easier, and</li>
<li>readers will be familiar with the style and this will help them understand your work.</li>

<div id="data" class="section level2" number="9.33">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.33</span> Data Management</h2>
<p>Almost everyone has had the experience of having written some really excellent work, and then had some terrible technology malfunction meaning that they lose everything. Some failure to backup stories are truly horrific. However, they all represent a failure on the part of the person involved to properly backup their work.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, it is very easy to keep copies of documents on the cloud, or even write straight onto the cloud. Talk to your advisor about what options are available in your institution for backing up your work. Make a plan early on, before you start with your study, and then stick with that backup plan as you move through your PhD. A really good option is to start working in one of the Open Science platforms. For example, OSF allows you to create a project where you can continue to use lots of different cloud based resources, and provides an integrated home for them (for an introductory video see here). OSF is also a great platform as it is free to use, and as long as individual files are less than 5 Gb, OSF will host them. This means that for most projects, raw data files can be stored on the cloud at no cost to the project.</p>
<div id="should-the-cloud-be-the-only-copy-of-your-data" class="section level3" number="9.33.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.33.1</span> Should the cloud be the only copy of your data?</h3>
<p>No. I suggest that you keep a hard drive with a copy of your data that you regularly deposit on a monthly basis, or after significant bouts of data collection such as field trips or experiments. A hard drive has the advantage that in the case of an internet outage, you always have access to your data.</p>
<p>Don’t try to store data on a laptop or desktop computer. These are for working files only. Backup is a separate operation where you store files. While computers are good for computation, they are frail and much more likely to suffer from catastrophic failures. They are also objects that are prone to being stolen.</p>
</div>
<div id="backing-up-in-the-field" class="section level3" number="9.33.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.33.2</span> Backing up in the field</h3>
<p>If you are going to be doing lots of field work, then you might want to make a specific plan about backing up data to the cloud during the field time. It may seem expensive, but I’m sure that it won’t be as expensive as losing the data. Alternatively, or in addition, you may want to take a portable storage option.</p>
<p>I still prefer field notes and data to be written into a book (preferably with waterproof paper such as <a href="https://www.riteintherain.com/">rite in the rain</a>). This allows you to make a photographic backup of the hard copy. Similarly, you can design datasheets that you use in the field with a pencil, and then photograph them to make a hard copy. I don’t like entering data directly into a laptop or other device. For me, the advantage is that it is too easy to mis-type a data point into a device, and then there is no record about what it should have been. These days there are multiple different ways to enter data into devices (including dictation), and so you should make your own plan about what you feel most comfortable with. If you do make a hard copy, you will then have to transcribe it later. If you make mistakes, you can go back to the hard copy.</p>
</div>
<div id="make-a-data-management-plan-and-stick-to-it" class="section level3" number="9.33.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.33.3</span> Make a data management plan, and stick to it</h3>
<p>However you decide to manage your data, make sure that you have a plan and that you stick to it. Don’t become a victim of some unexpected event that will lose your data. These events will still happen, but at least your existing data will be safe. Creating a secure data management plan (Figure <a href="paragraph.html#fig:Data-management">9.3</a>) is something that you should design and then talk through with your advisor. There is much more to data management than simply backing up your data. A great start is to read through the <a href="https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/BES-Guide-Data-Management-2019.pdf">British Ecological Society’s guide to Data Management</a>. <a href="SuppInfo.html">See part 3</a> for information about how to archive and distribute your data.</p>

<p>You probably won’t be able to think about all the potential pitfalls that may happen during your PhD, but if there are some obvious ones, then do consider them and see whether you can mitigate the circumstances should they occur.</p>
