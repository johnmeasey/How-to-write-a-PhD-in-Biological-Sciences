Acknowledgments", " Welcome Welcome to this guide on how to write a PhD in biological sciences. I will not tell you what to write. My intention is to tell you how to approach writing with respect to style, format and formula (planning). Writing a PhD is a daunting prospect. One does not put pen to paper, or, rather, finger to keyboard, only after finishing all of your experiments and/or labwork. Writing is actually something you should start from day one of your PhD, or even before day one, when you make the first initial pitch of big ideas to your advisor on what you want to do. If you can find the discipline to start writing from day one, then you are much more likely to make a much better go of it than waiting until the final, pressured, stretch. But to do this, you need to understand how to write a PhD thesis. You need to understand what you are aiming to achieve, and, crucially, you need to understand why you are doing your PhD. This guide intends to demystify the writing process so that the eventual goal is clear, and provide the necessary information on how to get there. It takes you from those initial ideas, all the way through proposal writing, posing hypotheses, testing them, and then how to write it all up. This book started as a series of blog posts written by me for my students (john.measey.com/blog). I wrote them because I felt that I was repeating the same advice year after year. Instead of rewriting comments on manuscripts time after time, I decided to consolidate them and put them all in one place. Later, I started looking for particular problems that students were having, and then writing blog posts to try to pre-empt those problems, and to provide solutions before tasks were completed. Finally, I have tried to fill in the missing gaps in the blog posts. But there are still plenty of gaps, and I regard this book as a work-in-progress. It is my intention that this book will always be added to, and improved by a community of practice, and I hope that this will include you. Why read this book Embarking on a PhD is intimidating as, for most students, it will be their first experience working within the academic system. The voyage of discovery is often made very frustrating as much of what goes on in academia is assumed knowledge. Academics accumulate knowledge throughout their careers, but what can be done for those who are uninitiated? What is needed is a guide that postgraduate students can refer to before, during and while making decisions about their time within academia. Note that this is not a rulebook. Your university, faculty and department will all have rule books that you should obtain and become familiar with. This book does not replace these rule books. Instead, this guide tries to explain how to achieve your goals of getting a PhD. There are times when this guide will be accurate and others when it will be vague, but providing some insight to point you in directions where you can explore more. The intention then is to provide you with a starting point from which you can establish your confidence in the academic writing process, and build your own creativity. Structure of the book This book is intended to be a guide. Originally, I called it the ‘Fool’s Guide to Writing a PhD in Biological Sciences’, but that didn’t fly. Don’t sit down and read it from cover to cover. If you do, then I think you have likely misunderstood what this guide is for. Instead, I want you to think about this book as a guide much in the same way that you might pick up a guide to a foreign city or country. However, instead of having hotels or restaurants recommended by name with a description of what makes them particularly praiseworthy, this guide provides a generic idea of what such places are for, what they tend to be like, the best ways to get to them, and pitfalls to avoid. None of the topics is explored in any great depth. This is deliberate as this guide is here to provide you with a starting point for you to explore if you think it is necessary. I have provided literature (where possible), and you should use this in the standard way to research the topic yourself should you need or want to know any more. In the same way, none of the advice provided in this book should override what you decide for yourself or with your advisor. Take your decisions from an informed position. The book is divided into four main parts: Part 1 - Part one contains core skills that are relevant to all postgraduate students. These core skills are those that you will need to build upon from the very beginning of your studies. You are likely to already have some experience in some of them, but understanding how they fit together will provide a solid basis for your PhD process. Both critical reading and regular writing are core skills that you will need to develop from the outset of your studies. One of the most important aspects of doing a PhD is knowing what you want to use it for once you’ve completed it. Hence, this section of the book asks you to look not only at short term day-to-day planning, but also what you want to do after you’ve finished, pointing out that you will have opportunities to open doors during the duration of your PhD. At the start of your PhD is the time to be thinking of the bigger questions both in your study area, and your life, and this section provides some pointers and things to consider. Working within academia is particularly stressful, and students should be aware of the state of their mental health, how to measure it and determine whether it is deteriorating, and if so, what you can do to help yourself. I also encourage you to participate in the scientific project, and become aware of your role as a scientist within society. Part 2 - Part two of the book sets out a practical guide to getting started with writing. The approach I’ve taken here is describing the production of a PhD in biological sciences which is made up of data chapters, and where each chapter is essentially a potential publication in a science journal. If you didn’t want to do a PhD but just wanted to write a publication, then most of what is here (and in Part 3) will be of use as you could take the same formulaic approach as given in this book. Similarly, if you were undertaking a MSc by research, this section would also be useful. The approach taken is ‘hypothesis-centric’, and how the entire chapter will be built around answering the hypothesis posed. This section explains how the hypothesis and all logical arguments that you make in the text are constructed from existing literature - standing on the shoulders of giants - with a practical guide on how to use citations. In addition to some nuts and bolts of how to write paragraphs, construct arguments, remain concise and avoid plagiarising, this section attempts to cover a lot of technical aspects of writing for the biological sciences. Part 3 - A typical PhD will consist of five data chapters where each data chapter is a publication. The standard formula is to write this is in sections consisting of an introduction, methods and materials, results and a discussion. Together with the title, abstract, references and supplementary information, all of these parts also make up most scientific publications. In this section of the book, I go through each of these components using a formulaic approach. To get you started writing, I suggest how you can build each section from an outline that is fleshed out with literature and works around a hypothesis (from Part 2). In addition to the sections needed for your thesis, I also cover parts needed to submit a paper, including the title page, writing the abstract, supplementary material, authorship, and acknowledgements. Therefore, this part of the book will be relevant for anyone setting out to write a scientific paper in the biological sciences, especially if you are having trouble getting started. Part 4 - The last and shortest section of this book talks about what you still need to do once your data chapters are written. For most PhD theses, you will need to write a short introductory chapter (sometimes a literature review) that comes before these data chapters, and a concluding synthesis chapter at the end. These chapters make your thesis into a ‘body of work’, and allow you space to reflect on what you have achieved in your PhD studies. I have framed their content at the bare minimum required, as many students will find themselves under a great deal of pressure to submit their thesis to a prescribed deadline. I also provide some alternative approaches for those who have the luxury of more time to attack these sections in more detail. The very end of the book sets out some reasons why you need to publish your thesis chapters. Throughout this guide you will find links and references of articles to read elsewhere. The reality is that there is a lot out there for you to read. I am not the only person to write a guide, and I can’t pretend that all the answers are here in this book. You will find that in your particular situation you need to look around. What I aim to do in this book is provide you with enough background information to help in your onward search, and provide you with enough inside knowledge to do a PhD. Why ‘A guide for the uninitiated’? I think that most people with doctorates would agree that a PhD is not awarded to people because they are particularly bright or smart. If you had to be a genius then I wouldn’t have a PhD. Indeed, I don’t consider myself to be particularly clever, but I worked very hard to get my PhD. I was hampered by the fact that I didn’t know anything about the goals and aims of the academic process of working towards a PhD, so it took a lot more work, wasted time, and (let’s not mince our words) real pain. The end product was a fraction of the potential that I could have achieved, if I had understood more about the process. If I had only had a guide to tell me what it was all about, I could have saved myself so much time and energy. In short, I feel that I was uninitiated, and this is the guide I wish that I had had. So, this guide is my practical attempt to help you to get the most that you can out of your PhD time. You will doubtless hear many academics referring to your PhD studies as the best of times. Their retrospective view probably won’t resonate with you as it’s easy to forget all of the hard work involved. But you can only make the most out of your time if you know what you are trying to achieve, and that is the aim of this guide. After all, yoru PhD should be an amazing journey of discovery that culminates with you achieving academic maturity: the ability to conceive and carry out scientific investigations. When you have a PhD, you become a scientist. You should be aware from the outset that doing a PhD is a major undertaking. It will take several years of your life and will impact heavily on your day to day life, to the extent that your mental health may suffer. A PhD represents the culmination of an incredible amount of work, not to mention that you’ve already had to complete one to three previous degrees beforehand. It may not be something that you ever finish to your own satisfaction. But finish it you must. What’s not in this book? Depending on just how early you are in your career, there is a lot missing from this book that has been provided in another book: How to publish in Biological Sciences. That book concentrates on publishing manuscripts, while this book concentrates on getting students started writing data chapters. Hence, if you want extra information about publishing in the biological sciences, I would point you to the other book. If you are still writing and generating content then this is the right book for you. If you want more help with publishing, and want help to demystify the publishing process, then How to publish in Biological Sciences has the content that you need: There is common ground in both books, and I will point to important chapters relevant to publishing in the other book that are not reproduced here. Acknowledgments Before I go on, there are a great many people that I need to thank. First and foremost are my students, past and present, who have inspired me to put together first the blog posts and then the book. It is because you wanted more that I put this together. I have also been a student, and have been inspired by colleagues around the world who are exemplary advisors. This book contains lots of links to blogs and articles written and posted freely on the internet by others who also aim to demystify and help. I thank this greater academic community (especially #academicTwitter) for sharing and inspiring. Thanks go to the many reviewers and editors who have taken their time to improve my writing. I am still learning. Lots of the text in this book has been improved by feedback from my students and postdocs. A special mention must go to my brother, Richard, who has hosted my lab website for more than a decade, and especially for saving blog posts from hacking attacks. Thanks also to Thalassa Matthews, who proofread many of the blog posts after I had published them late at night, so that I could correct them over breakfast in the morning. James Baxter-Gilbert, Ellie Brown, Sebastian Chekunov, Jack Dougherty, Anthony Herrel, Andrea Hurst, Allan Ellis, Joe McArthur, Andrea Melotto, Nitya Mohanty, Max Mühlenhaupt, Lisa and Mark O’Connell, Claire Riss, Pat Schloss, Ben Stevenson, James Vonesh, Carla Wagener all read or commented on different aspects of the book. Thanks are also due to my colleagues at the Centre for Invasion Biology, the Department of Botany and Zoology, and in the library at Stellenbosch University.

Both short-term and long-term planning will be one of the core skills that are the subject of Part I. You are likely to have had experience of each of these core skills before, but this part of the book tries to show you the importance of growing these skills and having the discipline to apply them regularly to achieve your goal of finishing your PhD. Some of the most important core skills involve critical reading and regular writing, skills that you will need to begin acquiring and practising from the outset of your studies. Managing your time day-to-day will help you find time to practice these skills alongside your other commitments. There are a lot of things to think about as you start your PhD, and for many of these, it is far easier to make informed decisions from the outset. Preparing yourself for the right mental state will also be very important for your ability to work under pressure. Getting into good habits at the beginning will put you in a commanding position later. This first part of the book aims to help you assess your current position, and realign yourself toward an optimum mindset for doing your PhD in Biological Sciences.

You may be in a new institution with new rules to follow. You may be far away from the people at home and friends who make up your support network. You will be meeting many new people and finding lots of other people who are interested in the same subjects as you. You should be talking about your shared ideas and aspirations for your PhD studies. Although it is a turbulent time, it is also a very exciting time. In this first chapter of the book, I intend to make you familiar with what a PhD is, how to approach thinking about it, and what to look for in an institution and advisor. You may already have some or all of these things fixed, but there is still some use in going over these basic points. Try to keep an open mind. Doing a PhD will take several years of your life, and may well define your future career prospects. Therefore, to say that this is a big decision is an understatement. It should not be a substitute for getting a job or a way of remaining a student for longer. If after reading this section you are in any doubt about whether or not a PhD is right for you, then I would suggest that you do need to think about it further. Don’t take my word for it, go and talk to people who have done a PhD (whether or not they now have a job), or those who are doing a PhD now. Especially if their experience is in your focal research area, they are likely to know a lot more about it. Your advisor and your institution are also happy to have you start your PhD. Your research and findings will be important to them. But they will also want to make sure that you finish your studies in a timely manner, as too many students start but do not finish their work, and many take too long to complete their studies. Universities are worried about two major aspects of those who start PhD studies: The time to completion in many countries worldwide is much longer than it should be. For example, 7.5 years is the median time to completion in the USA (Geven, Skopek &amp; Triventi, 2018), Europe universities have largely adopted the Salzburg Principles that doctoral programmes should be three to four years for full-time candidates (Christensen, 2005). Following this, an average is recorded as being between 3.5 and 4.5 years, with most institutions having reduced this time over the last 10 years (Hasgall, Saenen &amp; Borrell-Damian, 2019). Similarly, in China doctoral studies take three to four years to complete, although there are no official available statistics on time to completion (Powell &amp; Green, 2007; Zhu, Zhang &amp; Zheng, 2024). Completion rates are shockingly low. As bad as 50% in the USA (Litalien, 2015), 66% (within 6 years) in Europe (Hasgall, Saenen &amp; Borrell-Damian, 2019), but generally better in the sciences than other subjects (Park, 2005). Once again, there appear to be no official statistics for completion rates for those enrolled in Chinese PhD programmes (Zhu, Zhang &amp; Zheng, 2024). This has spurred many responsible for postgraduate students to try to ensure that they receive more support for their studies. But there is also the need for you as the student to comprehend right from the start that you are undertaking a major commitment that will likely impact many different parts of their lives. 2.1 What is a PhD? PhD comes from the Latin Philosophiae Doctor, and means “Doctor of Philosophy”. All doctorates derive from philosophy which is essentially the mother of all academic subjects. Obtaining a PhD allows you to (legitimately) call yourself a Doctor, and/or put the letters PhD after your name. You likely already have other letters (BSc, MSc, etc.) after your name, so this won’t be anything new). Becoming a Doctor is (in most parts of the world) the last step in your formal training as a researcher. However, in some countries (see list here) a further process (Habilitation) is required to lead research groups and/or teach at universities (leading the way to a professorship). PhDs are granted by universities (for the most part) and those are the institutions that set the standards. In many countries, these universities are required to meet the criteria of national bodies. Essentially, the top-down control is to ensure that the PhD qualification adheres to national and international standards. You may be aware that there are mutterings of whether qualifications are what they used to be. This has also been said of PhDs. However, I’m of the opinion that the standards are much as they were. You will really set the level on the bar of your own PhD. You either pass or fail. If your intention were to do the ‘bare minimum’ required to get a PhD, then you would have to look carefully for an advisor that would be happy to preside over such a thesis. Suffice it to say that this would be a very poor place to start, and if this were your attitude there may be lots of other reasons why doing a PhD really is not appropriate. It may be worth briefly considering the history of this qualification. Fifty years ago, a PhD was only taken by a small number of elite academics for whom it was treated as an apprenticeship to themselves become an academic (Houston &amp; Lunt, 2024). This has now changed, and in the 21st century, a PhD has become a qualification that can also be sought after outside academia. In some countries, where industry has an important voice in the content of a PhD, the synergy between industry and education appears to lead to national prosperity (Frick, McKenna &amp; Muthama, 2017). This, in turn, leads to important questions about what a PhD is and who it is for, especially when one considers the use of PhD statistics by the World Bank (see below). 2.2 Is a PhD more than a thesis? Yes. The thesis is really only the final evidence of all of the work and experience that you undertake while doing your PhD. The time that you spend doing your PhD will likely include participating in conferences, giving talks, participating in journal clubs, seminars, workshops and working groups. In addition to all of the writing skills, on which this book focuses, you will develop skills in techniques that relate to your particular subject area, and learn to communicate this to different types of audience. You will also learn and develop your skills in presentation, analysis and treatment of data. It is an intense learning experience. It should also be a fun and positive experience. While your PhD thesis will be a crucial and focal product of your PhD, and producing it will require a large amount of work, the thesis cannot be considered equivalent to the PhD. Having said all of this, we have not really answered the question: What is a PhD? Because every PhD is different, it’s quite a hard question to answer. Instead, I think that a better approach is to ask for the qualities that examiners are asked to assess when examining your PhD thesis. Again, this will be different in different institutions and countries. Some countries require an oral defence where a specialist jury is presented with the PhD dissertation and can grill the candidate for hours in public. Others, like my defense at Bristol University, happened behind closed doors with just two specialist examiners: an internal and an external. 2.3 Criteria used to judge PhD studies In order to provide you with some general idea of what is required, I list below the (edited) questions asked of examiners for a PhD thesis by my university (you should ask for the criteria at your own institution): Has the motivation for the objectives of the study been formulated satisfactorily? Do the research results constitute a meaningful contribution to the knowledge of and insight into the relevant field of study? Does the dissertation distinguish clearly between own, new contributions to, and known results in the relevant field of study? Is the candidate capable of evaluating the scientific meaning of their results and of placing this in context within existing knowledge in the field of study? Does the candidate show signs of independent, critical thinking or other signs of originality? Does the candidate show that they are sufficiently capable of doing independent research? Does the dissertation show that the candidate is sufficiently familiar with the relevant research techniques and methods? Does the dissertation show conversance with, and a critical attitude towards the pertinent literature? Is the material presented in a clear, systematic and logical manner? Is the linguistic, stylistic and technical editing of the dissertation acceptable? Are the research results acceptable for publication? If you compare these PhD requirements with those of an MSc, the key difference is that for a PhD you are required to produce a “meaningful contribution to the knowledge of and insight into the relevant field of study”, and show that you are “…capable of doing independent research”. Thus, a PhD degree prepares you to be an independent researcher, and so you are expected to have a critical attitude towards other research. 2.4 Who are the examiners? The next question to ask is who the examiners are? Again, different institutions will have different guidelines about who can be an examiner for a PhD. It is likely that most will agree that they should be holders of PhDs, in tenured positions (sometimes universities insist on full professorial appointments for examiners), and with experience of advising PhD students as well as having a proven record of their own publications. Hence, most PhD examiners will likely be senior academic figures. Their views are likely to have been informed by their own experience in academia, their own institutions and systems and prior experience of examining PhDs at other institutions. I can tell you that many examiners will treat the exercise the same irrespective of the questions asked of them. They will treat the examination as an extra-large task in peer review. This is not unfair. Personally, I think that there are some special extra hurdles required for a PhD (over and above 5 data chapters that are publishable): First is the clear ability to conceptualise and carry out a body of scientific work that is novel. Here I mean novel in that it has not simply been a repeat of some previous work on a different taxon or system. This is easier to judge from an oral defense, over reading the thesis. Second is the clear knowledge of how the work that is conducted fits into the bigger picture. That is, that the work demonstrates that the person is a scientist at a broader level than the narrow focus of their research. Third is whether the student has been able to bring the study together in a way that shows that it is more than the sum of its parts. In essence, together the 5 data chapters should provide a bigger overview of a broader topic, and show the direction of future work. I prefer a thesis that fits together within an explicit conceptual framework. I like PhD students to conceptualise how their chapters are interlinked, and to present this as a figure in the introduction of their proposal. A useful idea to be aware of is the ‘Hierarchy of Hypotheses’ (Heger &amp; Jeschke, 2018). In this approach, you are encouraged to consider the ‘bigger question’ in your research area, identifying both what studies have produced compelling evidence, and identifying knowledge gaps from a theory driven approach. Generally, it is only possible to consider these types of concepts once you are familiar with the literature (both theoretical and experimental). 2.5 What will you do after your PhD? It sounds silly to think about what comes after your PhD just as you are just starting, but the reality is that you always need to be planning ahead in order to make the most of what you are doing now (see more on planning here). During your PhD you will have lots of opportunities in many different areas of academia, teaching and practically applied areas. Knowing what you want to do when you finish will help guide your decisions so that you can maximise opportunities as they arise. Both inside and outside of academia, it is likely to be the contacts that you make that will help in your next career move. 2.5.1 Doing a PhD actually reduces your chance of employment and lowers your pay The reality is that most employers don’t want someone with a PhD, because it is a very academic qualification. It will take you so far down an academic rabbit hole, that for an employer there’s very little to use. PhDs were originally designed by academics as an apprenticiship for future academics (Houston &amp; Lunt, 2024). Most employers want people who understand the nuts and bolts of doing research, but who can apply this knowledge outside of the academic system. Employers who want people with PhDs (and there are a few) generally want professional researchers who are essentially academics. Good work if you can get it. You might end up only being fit to be an academic (a traditionally low paid sector which is likely what skews the figures of salaries of PhD holders), and that life is getting increasingly harder without any end to the expectations of the employers. Something only very few people will enjoy. At the same time, governments the world over, and especially developing countries, are providing bursaries for people to do PhDs. Why? The number of PhDs in a country is considered (by the World Bank) to be one of many measures of the development of that country. This is also true in East Asia, where the dramatic increase of postgraduate degrees in the last two decades has primarily been driven by efforts to accelerate national economic development (Jung, 2022). As the percentage of PhD holders per 100 000 of population gets larger, so countries can convince the World Bank that they are developing (and then get granted its favours, see Figure 2.1). This is all well and good, but strategically, governments should consider why they want these researchers in their populations, and more particularly for what kinds of jobs. It seems somewhat unfair to produce lots of young PhD holders that have no careers to join, or prospects to use their PhD just so that your government can tick a check box on their road to development, and so borrow more money from the World Bank. If you are from a developing country, you cannot assume that just because you are given a bursary by your government it follows that they will give you a job or a career. This will likely always be your own task. FIGURE 2.1: Where in the world are there most PhDs? In this map of the world, countries shaded are those that have data declaring the proportion of PhD (or equivalent) in their population (max percentage between 2010 and 2024 (Data from the World Bank). This ranges from 3.138% in Switzerland (red) to 0.008% in Guatemala (light yellow). Notably, there is no data (white) held in these years for some countries. In a recent report from the UK, it was found that by age 35, the earnings gap for those with PhDs was lower than the same cohort that left academia after their BSc or MSc (Britton et al., 2020). Women who obtain PhDs tend to increase their earnings by ~8%, while men reduce their earnings by ~9%. However, for those in Biological Sciences women seem likely to earn no more than those with undergraduate degrees by age 35. Men earn around 10% less. Studies with data from other countries are broadly in agreement (Polónyi, 2022). The point here is that you should not be doing a PhD in Biological Sciences because you think you will earn more money in your following career. Similarly, another qualitative study of the perception of PhD holders in the UK suggests that while doing a PhD provides a lot of personal value for the student, it lacks any monetary value from the career that follows: i.e. their PhD Worth doing but not worth having (Guccione &amp; Bryan, 2022). Another way of thinking about this is that it might be more important to you to have job satisfaction or lifetime happiness over a well paid job. To my knowledge, comparative levels of happiness is not (yet) reported, but could be a lot higher for those with PhDs, even though they may earn less. It is important to realise that many academics are looking for good students to do PhD work. This is because they need someone to do research within their groups, and students or postdocs do most of this work (see Chamberlain, 2016). For this reason, an academic you know while you’re doing your MSc studies may start to try to persuade you to do a PhD. This could be fantastic for you, it could be just what you’re looking for. But the reality is that you will never do a PhD for somebody else, you are always going to be doing it for yourself. If the only reason you are doing a PhD is because someone else told you that you should, then you are likely to have a really hard time. By the time you graduate, you may have a PhD but without any idea of what you’re going to do with it. 2.6 Think about your career before you start your PhD The last thing a PhD should be is a stop gap for you to fill your time because you can’t think of anything else to do. Although this does sound ludicrous, there are many people in academia who did PhDs for this reason, or simply because they were offered an opportunity to do a PhD and felt that they couldn’t turn it down. You should be aware by now that there are lots of people in academia who are ‘institutionalised’. By this, I mean that they have never had a job (or a life) outside of academia. This is not something that I can recommend for anyone. Such people are quite peculiar in many ways, and they tend to operate outside of the norms and standards of the rest of society. In particular, they make academia a more difficult place to work, because they tend to accentuate and maintain a lot of the silliness within these institutions. If you are worried about becoming such a person, then I think it would be advisable to take some time outside of academia. For example, if you have never worked but are thinking of doing a PhD, consider taking a year (or two) to do a job before starting a PhD. If it is in a related field it will likely help you greatly. I suggest that it will certainly help keep your feet on the ground, and in touch with some level of reality or normality, during your PhD. You’ll also have some experience and connections to go back to once you’ve finished. If you are planning a career outside academia, it is worth contacting potential employers and finding out how interested they are in employing people with a PhD in the subject area you are considering. Similarly, if you are considering a career inside academia, it is worth talking to people who are already in that job market (probably post-docs in your own group) about how easy or difficult they are finding it. Whatever you are planning to do, the right time for planning is before you begin your PhD. There is more written about planning your future here. 2.7 Don’t rely on becoming an academic Academia is getting more competitive. Whereas once it was almost certain that you would be employed as an academic after finishing your PhD, this is no longer the case. Indeed, the number of people who get PhDs is greatly increasing the world over, and most are in direct competition for a decreasing amount of academic posts. In 2019, 39% of respondents to a survey said that the most important reason they decided to enrol in a PhD programme was to pursue an academic career (Woolston, 2019). Further, 56% wanted academia as their first choice for a career. Yet in Belgium, for example, the numbers of PhD graduates entering the market nearly doubled (in the first 15 years of the 21st century) while academic positions remained static (Levecque et al., 2017). Universities appear to be exploiting this excess of qualified people to hire them on contracts, reducing the number of full-time positions. Essentially, this means that in most places your time as a PhD student, postdoc and junior lecturer will keep you outside the employers core staff. Joining those on the inside (with well-funded posts) becomes increasingly more difficult. Some have suggested that the world of academia is becoming more like a gang producing drugs, with those tenured academics earning good, secure salaries at the top of the pyramid, while increasing numbers of insecure poorly paid doctoral students and post-docs do most of the actual work (Afonso, 2014). 2.8 Doing a PhD is really hard work It’s not an MSc with an extra year. It really is much harder and tougher on you mentally and physically. The chances that you’ll end up jaded and malcontent with the entire academic system are very high (maybe even obligatory). At times, you are probably not going to be very happy while doing it (there are some exceptions of course), and it will likely have negative impacts on all the good things that you currently have in your life (think family, friends and relationships, as well as free time and fun). On the other hand, it can simultaneously bring joy and start you off on a lifetime trajectory. I don’t think students are made to understand how hard it is to do research. And how very, very hard it is to do important research. It’s a lot harder than taking even very demanding courses. What makes it difficult is that research is immersion in the unknown. We just don’t know what we’re doing. We can’t be sure whether we’re asking the right question or doing the right experiment until we get the answer or the result. Martin A. Schwartz (2008) 2.9 The importance of being productively stupid There will be many points during your PhD when you feel stupid because you don’t know what is the right thing to do. This is normal. Indeed, when you feel that you do know exactly what you are doing, this might be a more worrying moment that gives you more pause for thought. You will need to get your head around consistently feeling stupid and feel comfortable with saying ‘I don’t know’ without it causing you to feel like giving up. Schwartz (2008) talks about the importance of embracing that feeling of absolute stupidity when faced with many aspects of science. Facing that stupidity on a daily basis is necessary in order to have the correct attitude to your own studies. You can only really expect that your thesis will make you a little less stupid in the subject area of your choice. However, it may end up with you embracing more stupidity in ever increasing areas. When you feel comfortable with this stupidity, you’ll know that you have achieved one of the most important qualities of a scientist. 2.10 Your mental health will likely suffer Doing a PhD will be the cause of stress not only in your working life, but will also impact other areas of your life. Being aware of this at the outset will allow you to alert close members of your non-working life (think partner, family and friends) that they may well need to act as a support network. It is worth tracking your mental health during your PhD to check that you are not getting into difficulties, and I show you later how to do this. 2.11 Any PhD has to be yours It’s entirely useless to do a PhD for someone else. You must take complete ownership in order to do it. In fact, you need to be obsessed with the PhD subject and really want to do nothing else at all. A PhD is an obsession where you can be unwavering and manic in your fascination with a subject. Very few people really understand what a great privilege this is. If you don’t feel like a total maniac for learning, a PhD is not for you. 2.12 Does it matter where you do your PhD? Not all universities in the world have a PhD program. This means that you cannot do a PhD in some institutions. Larger institutions are more likely to hold PhD programs, have more potential advisors, and may even have funds for bursaries to conduct PhD studies. It is likely that you are going to need to do some work at the university in order to justify any bursary that they may want to give you. Typically this kind of work is the teaching of undergraduates which is a generally good and positive experience in the world of academia. The country where you study a PhD does not determine the quality of institution (see Figure 2.2). Rather look at the merit of the particular institution that you are interested in. Surveys like that from the Times Higher Education Supplement can help give you an overview. FIGURE 2.2: It’s not the country that determines the quality of your university. In this plot, you see the Times Higher Education (THE) World Ranking (2021) score for Research plotted by country (with ≥ 10 universities). Note that most universities in most countries have mean THE Research scores in the lowest quartile. Almost all countries that have institutions in the top quartile, have most of the institutions in that country in the bottom quartile. The point here is that you should look at the quality of the institution that you want to attend, rather than assume that all universities from certain countries have high or low research profiles. Depending on where you study might mean that you have different amounts of course time. There are some institutions that will carry on funding you for as long as you want to carry on studying. This is unusual. Most countries now have a restriction on the amount of time that you can spend studying a PhD, and given that completion times are so long (Litalien, 2015), there will be added pressure to finish. It may be important to consider the institutional support given to postgraduate students, outside of their research sphere. It does make a difference where in the world you do your PhD. There are some beautiful places to work. Some places are more expensive to live and therefore survive. If you are a biologist then you might want to consider where your study animals or plants are in order to decide your place to study. But most of all your choice of where to study is likely to be dictated by the presence of an advisor that you want to work with, and who wants you as their PhD student. Advisors are tied to their institutions, and any principal advisor will need to register you at their own institution, meaning that this will be where you spend your desk time. Some advisors might be more flexible than others, but it will be most likely that you will need to move to the institution where your advisor is based. 2.13 What to look for in an advisor Throughout this book, I will call the person who is the academic in charge of your PhD studies your ‘advisor’. I will not call them your supervisor. The reason for this is because I think it is much better for you to think of this person as giving you advice and not the person who tells you what to do. This comes back to the idea that the PhD is yours. It is not your advisor’s PhD. They will not write it. They will not do all the work that’s required for it. That will be yours alone. Just as I’ve attempted to do in this book, that person will give you advice. It will be up to you whether or not you follow that advice. Many of my students have not followed my advice. For some, this has been the right thing to do. For others, it has not. No one can know what the best thing to do is in different situations, because they will almost always be unique. You will be the expert on your project. That means that as the person closest to your project, you are the person who is best placed to make a decision. But your advisor can, and should, help you to make those decisions. Your advisor can help because your advisor has experience of doing research themselves. They hopefully have some experience of advising other students. And they should have some experience of having done research in your chosen study area before, including having published papers in appropriate journals. The advisor that you’re looking for should be offering or doing projects in which you are interested. There may only be a few people in the world that are doing this type of research, and you may end up having to choose between them. Hence, while you’re reading about how to pick a good advisor, your shortlist may only be of two or three people in the world. The project and subject area are going to be strong reasons driving your choices moving forwards. One of the best ways of picking a good advisor is by talking to past students, or current students that have been in the lab a while. You should ask them how happy they are with their advisor and whether they are receiving the support that they need to do their projects. A good advisor should have an open door so that you can talk to them whenever you need to. Thus, once you have talked to the students in their group, you should also make an appointment to talk to them about your project. It might not be one meeting, there may be several. The more contact you have with them, the more likely you are to be sure that this is the person whose help and advice that you want when conducting research over the next few years. Good advisors tend to have good strong research groups that work well together. You can look through the publications of a research group to see how well they work together. You should see the names of many of the graduate students appearing on publications demonstrating the level of collaborative engagement within the research group. A good advisor should have a good network. Both during your PhD studies and after them, you will rely primarily on the network of your advisor as a basis to building your own network. For example, you will go to meetings that they go to, you will be introduced to people that they know, and you may have opportunities to collaborate with people within their networks (see Adams, 2012). Doing a PhD with an advisor that has no network and that does not link up with other academics (or worse is disliked by other academics) might mean that your own work is not recognised, or even sidelined. You can easily check on the network of a potential advisor by looking at the collaborators in their publications, or on their website. Having said this, the best academics also tend to be very busy, and that may mean that they do not make good advisors. The balance is definitely very tricky, and one of the best ways for advisors to make sure that you have enough time for all of your students is to limit the number of students you have. Clearly, this works against prospective students. 2.14 What to avoid in an advisor Remember that relationships occur on a one-to-one basis, and it may be that not every advisor gets on with every student. There are some advisors who have many problems with many students, and these are best avoided no matter how high their profile is (Abbott, 2004; see Malaga-Trillo &amp; Gerlach, 2004; but also see Vences &amp; Zardoya, 2004 for alternative viewpoints). There are other advisors who are so busy that they are never able to meet with their students, and pass this task on to somebody else in their group. Again no matter how high profile these people are, if they can’t advise their own students they are best avoided. Chamberlain (2016) suggests that there are 10 types of academic advisors, implying that 9 of these are rather dysfunctional. At the end of the day, there is no such thing as the perfect advisor. You will likely have to make a trade-off on the above points with someone who has a project that they are willing to advise you on, and your chosen area of research. 2.15 What makes a good project? The most obvious point to make here is that a project should be something that you want to do and that you’re prepared to dedicate yourself to for ~3 years. Projects that are cross-disciplinary are likely to lead to more opportunities in more disciplines. You may want to make sure that you do not narrow your focus entirely into a single technique or method. If you view your PhD as a training experience, then it is better not to be doing exactly the same techniques that you have mastered previously, for example during your MSc. It is worth bearing in mind that academia has trends and fashions and that becoming an expert in a brand new technique could land you a job and career. It could equally mean that your entire knowledge of a subject area is replaced by a better approach within one or two years. 2.16 Funding your PhD studies Funding may be one of the biggest obstacles that you come across when wanting to do a PhD. It’s important that you consider the funding of your PhD in two separate ways. 2.16.1 The funding that you need to live This money is typically called a bursary or stipend depending on where you are in the world. It seems to me that many countries offer bursaries that are not actually enough to live on (e.g. buy food, rent a house, etc.). If you’re offered a PhD bursary, especially if it’s in another country, then do check on the living cost at that location and whether or not the bursary that you are being offered will be sufficient money in order for you to survive. Also, be very careful to check how long the bursary is for. For example, at my university a PhD bursary is given only for 3 years. After this three-year funding period, you will be expected to have submitted your PhD for examination. If you need further funding to live while your PhD is being examined, and before you graduate then you will need to get a job. There is no more money! It’s a really good idea to talk to people who have already done a PhD to find out more about the different available bursary opportunities, and how people manage with and without them. There is no one single model, and the more people you talk to the more likely you are to discover one that might suit you. Of course, conferring with other people can include reading the accounts of many different people who share their experiences on social media. There are blogs and Twitter accounts dedicated to this stuff. Try and be as open-minded as you can. 2.16.2 The cost associated with your studies. The money associated with the project that you are doing also needs to come from somewhere. Depending on where in the world you can do these studies there will be different expectations of where this money comes from. This is a very important topic for you and your potential advisor to discuss. During the proposal phase of your PhD you’ll be expected to put together a budget to determine the total costs of your studies. You or your advisor should have a ballpark figure of how much this is going to cost and have some idea about where the money is going to come from. Again if you are moving to a new location to do a PhD then beware that costs are not the same in different countries. For example, you might be used to paying very little money for accommodation and travelling in the field, essentially meaning that you can do as much fieldwork as you like. But in some countries fieldwork will make up such a substantial proportion of the funding that you may be limited in the amount of field work that you can afford to do. It is possible that your potential advisor will tell you that they don’t have any funding for a project that you may want to do. This is both a curse and an opportunity. There are many opportunities to raise money to fund PhD projects. Raising the funding yourself is one way of making sure it really remains your project. But the availability of this kind of funding does vary from country to country and you may want to embark on the fundraising side of your PhD before you register. Especially if you have a limited amount of time once you have registered in order to complete your PhD studies. Some projects are much cheaper than others. For example, if your intention is to sequence genomes of every animal or plant that you work with, the finance required will likely be far greater than your bursary. If however your intention is to do a PhD that models distributions of populations of animals and plants, then the entire costs for your study may only add up to a computer, remote access to a computing cluster and data storage. Funding, and the availability of funding, may well be the tipping point that makes you decide where you will do your PhD studies, and with whom. If you haven’t already got the message (see above) then these are important decisions and you may be better off postponing the start of your PhD in order to raise money, and do the project you want, in the place you want, and with the person you want to advise you. 2.17 Core skills Although this book is about writing your PhD in Biological Sciences, there are a number of core skills that you, or anyone doing a PhD will need. This section of the book aims to give you a foundation on these core skills and encourage you to use them from the very start of your PhD studies. You may well find that you already have one or more of these core skills to a certain degree, but I would encourage you to read the chapters in this section and reflect on your proficiency of these core skills and build them up where you need to. Time management Planning Communication Upskilling Mental health Advisor relations Critical Reading Regular writing A life scientific Improving Each of these core skills will make doing your PhD easier. These core skills will extend beyond your PhD into your working life beyond such that you can consider them to be life-skills. None of them are independent, instead they are all integrated with each other and require careful thought and reflection from you about how you can improve each of them. References Abbott A. 2004.

"],["time.html", "Chapter 3 Time management 3.1 Start planning your time today 3.2 Multitasking 3.3 Time management hacks 3.4 Don’t stop managing your time", " Chapter 3 Time management How much time during the week do you spend doing nothing? Do your friends and colleagues ever find you sitting staring into space? My guess is that because you are starting a PhD, you are used to some level of time management and you can fill all of your waking hours every day of the week without the need for sitting staring into space because you have nothing to do. We all have exactly the same amount of time in a day or a week. People who accomplish more in that time are doing so because they manage that time efficiently. You may well know such people and be amazed that they not only use their time at work wisely, but they also have time for sports, socialising and other hobbies. This is because once you have learned the skills of time management, including focussing on tasks that you have been assigned to do when you choose to do them, you’ll find that you can accomplish much more. Research has shown that time management is empowering having a positive relationship with job satisfaction and work-time balance and negatively with stress (Claessens et al., 2007). Moreover, postgraduate students who use time management techniques were found to have improved mental health (Liu, Song &amp; Teng, 2023). This chapter is meant to encourage you to manage your own time and help you start planning so that you can conduct all of the work needed for your PhD, and also find time for your life’s needs during your PhD studies. 3.1 Start planning your time today At the start of your PhD, you are likely to have to attend classes, and so you will already have a fairly full time-table. This makes the task of planning your time slightly easier as you already know when you will be busy attending class. This period will give you a limited amount of free time (i.e., time that you have to manage), and you can start using this wisely to schedule both critical reading and academic writing tasks there. 3.1.1 Planning the total duration of your PhD studies Once you know the subject of your PhD and what questions you need to answer with what experiments and observations, you will have to plan your remaining years of study to make sure that you can get all of these experiments done in the time allotted. Figure 3.1) gives you a visual idea of what this plan might look like. In addition to showing the time when you will be busy and on what tasks, it also includes goals and conferences. Of course, your own planning chart might look much more complicated and have many more rows of tasks to achieve. For example, you might want to split the time spent for each chapter by time spent acquiring data from that spent analysing and writing about it as separate rows. My suggestion would be to keep this document dynamic so that you can add to it and adjust it as time goes by. Doing so will ensure that your planning is flexible and can take into account the unexpected. FIGURE 3.1: Knowing when you are going to do the different work that makes up your PhD is critical. In this Gandt figure, I have broken the different tasks that are needed to complete a PhD into different chapters (rows) which include four data Chapters (C1-4) and a technique chapter (T1). For planning purposes over three years, I have split each year into quarters (Q1-4) shown as columns. In this example, collecting the data for the four data chapters is seasonally sensitive (data can only be collected during Q2), meaning that these are immediately prioritised for this work. The technique chapter involves intensive lab time, and so can be completed during Q3 and Q4. Also included are the goals for completing chapters (shown as yellow stars) and important conferences where the results of chapters T1 and C1 are presented. Also indicated is time to write the introduction (Intro) and concluding chapters (Conc). However you choose to plan the period of your PhD, you will need a plan for the entire duration of studies that ensures that you have time to collect all of the data you need, analyse and write it up in the time you have available. 3.1.2 Day-to-day planning Calendars are extremely useful for planning, and you should find that your phone or email app already has a built-in calendar that you can easily use. Web or cloud-based calendars are particularly good as you can access them from different devices and choose how they send you alerts and notifications for events. You probably already have one that you use, so I’d encourage you to keep using that same software and build on the framework you already have for your day-to-day planning. When it comes to day-to-day planning it is really useful to know your own rhythms and abilities. Although everyone is different, everybody will have times in the day when they are more or less productive. I find that I can concentrate most in the early mornings while drinking a cup of coffee. Other friends do their best work late at night. Many of my colleagues sleep after lunch as their bodies concentrate on the serious task of digesting their large lunches. Becoming aware of your own best (and worst) times for concentrating is an important pre-requisite to your day-to-day planning as you will be able to set your best times for the work that requires the most concentration, like critical reading and scientific writing. If you are new to time management, then what follows is a suggestion to get you started. However, there are many many different approaches and you should find what works for you. Add all current commitments (lab meetings, classes, etc.) to your calendar. Divide your day into 40 minute blocks. These are the blocks of time that you have to allocate to doing different tasks or assignments. The chances are that you already have commitments (such as classes), so you may have an existing framework of start and end times that fit logically for you. Of course, the time blocks don’t have to be 40 minutes - they can be longer or shorter. The aim is to find a period through which you can concentrate from beginning to end on a single task. If you can only manage 20 minutes at the beginning of your PhD, you will need to be extra strict with your time management so that throughout your studies you can slowly increase your concentration abilities up to 40 minutes and even beyond. Make a list of things that you find rewarding. Rank these from top to bottom with your favourite at the top. Examples might be playing a game on your phone, catching up with your instant messaging, drinking tea, going for a walk, having a snack or playing table-tennis. These rewarding activities will need to be achieved in 5 to 10 minutes, so don’t include things like baking a cake which would take much longer, which would require you to return home via the supermarket etc. You also need to consider that these activities should not rely on other people too much as their schedules may not match your own. Dedicate the 40 minute blocks to different tasks in your day. Focus on having regular tasks for skills such as critical reading and scientific writing. In the 5-10 minute gaps between the blocks allocate the best rewards (highest ranked) for the tasks that you like least. Plan for at least two weeks in advance, but also keep an eye on the planning of your total study duration so that you know when you need to go to the field and accomplish your goals. The idea of the above planning with tasks and rewards is to use motivation (Figure 3.2) to drive you to do the tasks that you like the least, and eventually to make them your favourite tasks. This is a really very simple but powerful way in which you can train yourself to manage your time, become more productive and start enjoying your least liked tasks the most. FIGURE 3.2: Using rewards after doing tasks is a very easy way to manage your time enjoyably. Humans respond very well to rewards, and you can use this system to help yourself do your least liked tasks by rewarding yourself with your most liked activities. My suggestion is to use colour coding in your calendar so that you can quickly see what you are doing next. You could use colours to code for the places where you will conduct each task block. For example, you could code your desk blue, the lab yellow and meetings red. This will allow a quick glance to let you know where you need to go between tasks. It will also determine the kind of environment that you need. Try to keep your desk environment for tasks that require concentration, and keep your reward environment separate. Associating certain spaces with different tasks and rewards will really help you quickly transition between roles when the time comes. 3.1.2.1 Don’t reward failure to do activities The idea of using chunks of time to do certain tasks and then rewarding them will only work if you actually do the tasks that you allocate to yourself. If you sit down but fill all of your time with displacement activities then do not reward yourself afterwards! Make sure that you keep the rewards for positive reinforcement only. If you start rewarding yourself for not working, then you’ll actually be training yourself not to work. Obviously, this is not what you want but the discipline of working and then rewarding yourself is entirely in your own hands. At the same time, don’t be too hard on yourself. If you filled the time with the task given, you can reward yourself with your intended reward - even if you did not finish the task. The important point is to fill the time with the task at hand. There will be more time in your week for coming back to unfinished tasks. 3.1.3 Remember to include time to be healthy When planning your day, you do not have to include details like sleeping, eating, sports and time with your family and support network. However, as you get busier it is a good idea to make sure that you do have time to get adequate sleep, food and exercise time. There is research that shows that if you fail to get enough sleep or nutrition, post-graduate students cannot maintain their concentration on normal tasks, eventually leading to burnout (Renu &amp; Dua, 2024). Hence, when you are especially busy, time management becomes a critical skill in order to ensure that you remain healthy. 3.1.4 Thinking time As outlined elsewhere in the core-skills, much of what you do during the day will need time to be processed in your brain. This could be overnight, during REM sleep, or it could be during discussions with friends and colleagues. This thinking or reflective time is important. You may want to include topics to think about or talk about in your day-to-day activities. For example, a workout at the gym might become a session to think about the most recent paper you read in your critical reading session, or a walk with a friend might be an opportunity to chat with them about some difficult problem you encountered during a writing session. Remember to balance such work times with times when you give yourself a break from thinking about work (actually avoid thinking about it). These times are also important to give your brain a rest from the intense thinking that is involved in reflection. Over time, you will learn which activities are best for thinking and reflection. Once you know what they are, be sure to use them to the best possible effect. During your week, you should plan to have at least three of these periods when you have time set aside to think and a topic on which you are reflecting. 3.1.5 Beware of displacement activities These are things that you do that take up your time when you should be focusing on the work that you planned to do. Common Examples: arranging your working space and equipment social media emails and correspondence direct messaging apps chatting with friends watching TV or listening to the radio computer games The danger with displacement activities is that they can become habit forming. Remember that social media sites are designed to take your time (for the purpose of you watching their advertisements). They are well-known to be addictive, and if you are already hooked the best way to manage them is to place your time on them strictly within bounds. Learn to recognize displacement activities - once you know what they are either avoid them (if they are not productive) or carve out special time for them (if they are necessary). 3.1.6 To-do lists Humans find it very satisfying to cross out tasks on a list once they are completed. Having a to-do list alongside your calendar might really help motivate you to a task based system of time management. You can write a list out for your week, adding items as they come up and crossing them out as you complete them. Then carry the uncrossed out items on the list over to the next week. I encourage my students to have these lists in their meeting books so that we can check through them when we have student-advisor meetings. To-do lists don’t work for everyone, so this is something that you might want to try and see whether it helps motivate you. 3.2 Multitasking Multitasking is trying to proficiently conduct several tasks at the same time. First, I am going to emphasise that this old idea of multitasking is a myth. Secondly, I am going to encourage you to multitask while being fully aware that one or more of these tasks is not going to be done proficiently. You can do this when the tasks that you are trying to accomplish are non-critical and do not require all of your attention. Investigations have consistently shown that those who are trying to split their attention between two or more tasks do so at a cost to the tasks themselves (Gilbert, Tafarodi &amp; Malone, 1993; Wang &amp; Tchernev, 2012). For example, a study of students who were instant messaging while reading showed that this multitasking increased their reading time by more than 20% (Bowman et al., 2010). Similarly, trying to watch television while conducting academic work resulted in poor comprehension and memory recall (Armstrong, Boiarsky &amp; Mares, 1991). The number of studies that show that humans are not capable of conducting several tasks proficiently at the same time is now overwhelming. The above information should be of concern to us when we are conducting critical procedures that require all of our attention, such as driving a car, piloting a plane or conducting an operation. However, there will be tasks that you need to do that do not require all of your attention. Some aspects of your PhD might be incredibly boring and repetitive so you can do them with your eyes shut! Your PhD will require a lot of activities that require 100% of your concentration. They will also have activities that require less of your attention. Know what these relevant tasks are and adjust your time accordingly throughout the day. High-concentration activities should be done when you are most alert. See below to see how to recognise this. Low-concentration activities provide you with opportunities to conduct additional tasks. Note that although you can do different things at the same time, you won’t actually be multitasking, because your concentration will be flipping from one task to another constantly during this period. That’s why I’d advise only doing low concentration tasks together when your brain can cope with the constant switching. Some examples might help. If you work in a lab where you need to fill pipette boxes or conduct a lab clean every week, schedule these tasks alongside a colleague and use the time to catch-up on their research and tell them how yours is going. This would be a more productive use of your time than listening to music. If you don’t have an appropriate colleague there, then consider downloading a podcast from your subject area, or an audiobook on something relevant. Be sure that you have note taking equipment close-by so that you can quickly jot down ideas as you are listening. 3.2.1 Priority activities I cannot list all of the priority activities that you will need to perform during your PhD, instead I will list some general ones that everybody is likely to have. When you schedule time for these priority activities, you will not only need to put away things that might distract you from your task (such as a phone), but you should also try to clear your mind of worries and other aspects of your life that might impinge on this time. If there’s something happening in your life that you really can’t pull your mind away from, then it would be worth rescheduling any priority activities that you might have for that day. If such worries stretch for weeks or even months, then this is something that you should alert your advisor to. 3.2.1.1 Academic writing Perhaps it is no surprise to find out that I consider writing a priority activity from which you should not be distracted (or attempt multitasking). For this reason, it is important to prioritise time for writing in your weekly schedule. Throughout this book I emphasise that academic writing is a skill that you need to practice, meaning that you can’t wait until the end of your PhD to start writing your thesis. Similarly, at the beginning of your PhD you should not expect to sit down and write perfectly. It takes time and practice, and this is why writing regularly is the best way to improve your writing skills. Note here that I am talking about academic writing. I am not talking about writing an email or sending IMs to your friends. Academic writing, the subject of this book, is something quite different and no amount of writing IMs or emails will help you. 3.2.1.2 Critical reading Like writing, critical reading requires all of your attention and is a skill that you will need to learn (see Part II). Critical reading is going to help the most with your writing skills, without actually writing. Of course, critical reading does involve writing, and I encourage you to read the chapter on this topic later in the book to find out more. 3.2.1.3 Meetings with your advisor Your regular meetings with your advisor should be times when 100% of your attention is focussed on getting all of the information and advice that you need in the shortest time possible (see Part I). 3.2.1.4 Running equipment and machinery Much of the equipment that you will use during your PhD will be very costly very likely accompanied with expensive consumables. Mistakes will happen, but if you break equipment or ruin consumables because you are distracted, then I don’t consider this a mistake, but your own folly. You now know that some tasks require all of your attention, and this will include many tasks involving equipment and expensive consumables. Give these the full attention that they deserve. 3.2.2 Non-priority activities Having put together your timetable (above), you will already know what your non-priority activities are, because you had to find time to fit them in. My suggestion is to use a different colour for these tasks. They are the tasks that will drop away when you get especially busy, or have another additional task that you didn’t foresee. Non-priority tasks are often important, but don’t need to be done immediately. Even if you post-pone tasks like these, it is a good idea to keep an eye on them to make sure that they don’t get dropped entirely. These non-priority tasks will allow you to keep your calendar flexible so that you can accommodate additional or unforeseen tasks. Remember to make sure that your advisor agrees with you about what is a non-priority task. For example, if you consider lab meetings as non-priority and stop turning up, your advisor might not agree. 3.3 Time management hacks You will find lots of advice out there on the internet about how to hack your time management and improve your efficiency. These ideas are numerous, and some are based on research that shows that breaking up intensive concentration time into short sessions followed by rewards is very efficient. My suggestion is to give such hacks a go when you are not too busy. If they work for you, then that’s great. However, don’t rely on a hack that you have never used before during an especially busy time. During busy times you should be using tried and tested methods of time management that you already know work for you. 3.3.1 The Eisenhower Matrix Using this method, you divide every task into one of four different quadrants as shown in Figure 3.3). Once you have decided where a task sits, you can decide how to handle it. FIGURE 3.3: The Eisenhower Matrix helps you decide how important the different tasks are, and then how to deal with them. Prioritising tasks will be difficult at first, but as you get busier it will become essential for you to unsure that you accomplish all of the work to complete your PhD. Urgent and Important: Do this right away as it is likely to impact on other goals. Important but Not Urgent: Schedule such tasks into your calendar. Urgent but Not Important: Depending on how busy your calendar is, you might want to consider asking someone else to help with these tasks. Neither Urgent nor Important: You won’t have time to do these tasks when you are busy, so keep them in a list for when times are less intense. 3.3.2 The Pomodoro Technique This is a time management method that breaks work into focused 25 minute intervals, called “Pomodoros”. These are then followed by short five minute breaks. Once you have completed four Pomodoros, you can take a longer break of 15-30 minutes. The technique is said to help improve focus, reduce distractions, and prevent burnout by encouraging regular breaks while maintaining a structured approach to work. It is particularly effective for managing tasks that require sustained attention like thesis writing. This might be especially useful if there are a group of your who all time your Pomodoros together. You get the reward of sharing the breaks, plus the calm during those concentrated efforts. 3.3.3 SMART goals You are likely to find SMART goals everywhere, as they are a very popular way ensuring that goals are met, including time management. Originating in 1981, SMART goals were first conceived as a framework for setting clear and achievable goals in management contexts (Doran, 1981). They are now used practically everywhere and are well worth knowing about: Specific: Clearly define the goal with a detailed and focused objective. Measurable: Ensure the goal can be quantified or tracked with specific metrics. Achievable: Set a realistic and attainable goal given available resources and constraints. Relevant: Align the goal with broader objectives and ensure it is meaningful and valuable. Time-bound: Set a clear deadline or time-frame to accomplish the goal. I will not go into SMART goals in detail here, but there is plenty to read including books by Stevens (2013) and Hyatt (2023). 3.3.4 Batch tasking You may find that your to-do list contains a number of similar tasks that would be better if performed together. For example, you may need to make five different telephone calls in relation to different parts of your studies. By batching these calls together into one of your 40 minute task slots it will ensure that you get them all done without eating into other productive time. 3.3.5 Saying no Be aware that while your time management skills might be champion, you will be impacted by those around you. This means that you might need to explain to others that you already have priorities and cannot always give them the time they are requesting. These could be commitments to people at work or people in your social and support network. Being able to prioritise these commitments is also important as you need to remember that you do rely on your support network. As you get deeper into your PhD studies, you will get busier and your time will get tighter. You should know when these periods are coming up (from the planning of your total study duration), and this will allow you to get ready for them. As you become better known in your institution, you’ll also find that people start asking you to do extra tasks. These could be favours for friends, or special assignments for your advisor. When you are asked to do these extra tasks you should take the time to look at your calendar and ask yourself where that extra time is going to come from. If you are in your busiest time and the deadline is before that ends, then you might have to say no. However, if your calendar is more open you can replace some of your activities with the task so that you can achieve it. You do need to be clear to yourself and the person you are doing the task for exactly what the task is, when is the deadline and how much time it will take you, and what you won’t be doing during that period in order to do the extra task. Many such tasks are worthwhile, and it may well be in your interest to find the time to do them. Your calendar should be helping you to commit time, not making your time allocation so rigid that you have to say no to everything. If you do need to say no, give an explanation about why you have to say no this time and suggest when you might be able to say yes in the future. If the task is time-limited and won’t recur in the future, then be sure to be thankful for the opportunity and express your regret that you can’t take part this time, but look forward to future opportunities. You do not want to close doors by saying no, you need to make it clear that there will be times in the future when you would welcome another opportunity to participate and that you want to say yes. 3.3.6 Delegation During your busiest times it may be that you will not be able to complete all of the tasks that you have listed. For example, you might need to attend a conference but your experimental plants still need to be watered and tended to. Use the planning of your total study duration to identify when these periods are likely to be, and alert your advisor well ahead of time (2 - 3 months). You should be able to come up with a solution so that you can go to the conference (or other task) while someone else looks after your experiment. However, that person may well need training, hence you will need to flag this and organise for cover well in advance. 3.4 Don’t stop managing your time Once you have learned how to manage your time, you should find that this is a useful life-skill that you can take with you after you complete your PhD. Most importantly, it will empower you to have free time that you can devote to yourself and your family and friends. The next chapter takes these planning and managing ideas to planning ahead for your future. References Armstrong GB, Boiarsky GA, Mares M-L. 1991. Background television and reading performance.

They rebelled. They evolved. There are many copies. And they have a plan.” Battlestar Galactica Having a plan is an essential part of your PhD strategy. You might think of it as a shining star guiding your way through the dark times. Or, perhaps like me, you are prompted to remember the Cylons in the sci-fi series Battlestar Galactica. However it takes you, having a plan will hold you in good stead throughout your PhD as it will ensure that you have something beyond your PhD to focus on. There is a temptation, once you have started and invested many years in academia, to simply fall into step and see where it leads you. This lack of a plan will see your life collapse around you once you finish your PhD and wonder what it was all for. Or, more likely, you will get part way through your PhD and start questioning exactly why it is taking up so much of your life. This chapter aims to help you build a plan for your future career and aid you to see how you can improve your chances on reaching your goal. 4.1 What is a long-term plan? A long-term plan sets a goal for you in 10-15 years from now. This is likely to be a career choice, like joining a particular business or having a position in a certain company. Beware of having a long-term plan to become an academic, as there may not be opportunities (see Part I). Equally, your long-term plan could be about the lifestyle you want to achieve in the long-term, or about where you want to be in the world. All of these are valid plans and they are totally up to you to envisage. This may be the first time you are thinking about it, or you may have always known what your long-term plan was. In either case, once you have decided on your plan you next need to decide on medium- and short-term goals that will guide your decisions during your PhD years, and the moves that follow. 4.2 Long-term plans need medium- and short-term goals You need to consider your three time periods (see Figure 4.1): Long-term (10 - 15 years) Medium-term (5 years) Short-term (2 years) The first thing to realise when you are planning for your future is that long-term plans need action in the short- and medium-term. It is only by achieving these actions that will help you reach your long-term goal. Personally, I like the three time period idea as short-term plans might only include getting something ready for the medium-term, and not necessarily doing that action. If you don’t like to think of specific time periods, you can think of the short-term as the time during your PhD. Medium-term is the years after your PhD and long-term is your career path. Short-term planning will consist not of having to find your primary occupation, but adding tools to your tool-box in order that you have a complete tool box for the long-term. Similarly, you can think of medium-term not as being employed in the actual job you want to do, but in a step along that particular career path. FIGURE 4.1: Having a plan during your PhD is invaluable This diagram shows how your short-term plan is related to your medium-term planning, and how that will influence your long-term goals. In turn, your long-term plans will impact on what you do in the medium- and short-term. 4.2.1 Teaching example If your goal after completing your PhD includes teaching in secondary or tertiary education, you are going to want to make sure that you have teaching experience. Planning to have a teaching experience sufficient to put on your Curriculum Vitae (CV) in the next 2 years is probably unrealistic as you may well be in the midst of your PhD studies (obviously, in some institutions you may get immediate opportunities). But you can plan that within the coming two years you will know exactly when in the medium-term your teaching experience will happen. In turn, this will require that in the short-term you need to actively look for those opportunities. 4.2.2 Research example If your goal after completing your PhD is for a career in research, then there are definitely steps that you can take in the short- and medium-term that will increase your chances of success. Most research positions require fundraising as a central component of, what is essentially, project work. This means that you will want to have experience of fund raising, probably through grant writing. You might not need to write a grant in the short-term, but you should be looking for opportunities of granting bodies to apply to, and projects that you have the capacity to undertake in the medium-term. Such projects might not be you on your own, but with other people in your group or institution, or connections in your network from another institution. You will also want to look for opportunities to publish. Publishing your thesis chapters is likely to follow in the medium-term (i.e. once you’ve finished your thesis), but there are likely to be opportunities before this to start getting publications on your CV. Remember that these might not be research papers, but could be publishing a literature review or another type of paper (Measey, 2022). 4.2.3 Other additions to your CV Teaching, grant writing and research papers are all solid items to add to your CV during your PhD studies, but you may want to consider having some additional items if these will be skills required in your long-term plans. For example, you may be interested in having experience in administration and management. It may well be that you can volunteer to fulfil these roles in your research group or department. For example, you may want to get elected into a student representative role and sit on the department’s management committee. Or it may be that someone has some administration exercise that you can help them with. You won’t know unless you ask. 4.3 Consider the letter of reference that your advisor will write An important consideration for your medium-term plan is that you will likely be asking your advisor to write a letter of reference for you. In the short-term you can find out from people who already work in your long-term career choice what the ideal reference letter consists of. Once you know what is needed, you can in the short-term begin to make sure that you have all of these elements in place. For example, your advisor can’t write a letter of reference that says you have great organisational skills unless you have helped them with organising something. If, like me, you have a bad memory for things that you have done, you will also need to write down these activities and examples of when you did them so that you can remind your advisor when the time comes for them to write a letter of reference. Advisors are busy people, and they don’t always notice all of the different things that you are doing. So make sure that you remind them what you have achieved during your time with them, especially when it comes to writing that letter of reference. Don’t rely on them to remember! 4.4 Changing your long-term plans Don’t worry about changing your long-term plans. Life often happens, and you may want or have to change your plans. In the short-term, changing long-term plans is easy. You should realise that the further you go down a particular career path, the more difficult it becomes to make long-term changes. However, if you do, then it is not impossible, and will need you to make some short-term plans in order to make those changes. The other book has advice for getting a job inside academia, as it also does for leaving academia for a job outside (Measey, 2022). 4.5 Share your plans Don’t forget to tell the people around you of your plans for the future. Remember that they may know about opportunities that they can only pass onto you if they know what your plans are. They may also be able to provide you with specific advice about exactly what experience you need. Having a plan is probably one of the most valuable assets that you can hold throughout your PhD days. If you have read all of this and still don’t know what yours is, then I’d suggest that you start to think about this now, and don’t push it into the future when not having a plan is going to be increasingly problematic.

"],["email.html", "Chapter 5 Communicating by email and messaging apps 5.1 Email 5.2 Use of WeChat or WhatsApp during your PhD studies 5.3 Other Social Media platforms", " Chapter 5 Communicating by email and messaging apps Throughout your PhD, you will be expected to communicate with your advisor and other professionals inside and outside of academia using email. In some contexts, you may also be expected to use social media apps like WeChat and WhatsApp to communicate either directly or in groups. The chances are that you have already written a great deal of emails and instant messages in the past. However, this does not mean that the style and content of those emails and app posts will be appropriate when communicating during your postgraduate studies. In this chapter I will start by considering some issues around correct use of email, and then move onto direct messaging apps below. 5.1 Email In addition to meeting in person, email has become a standard way of communicating between students and their advisors. If your project has any collaborators, then you will likely also interact with them over email, perhaps without ever meeting them in person. Although other platforms for communication are available (e.g. Slack), email has the advantage that it provides a paper trail (time stamped, and institutionally traceable), is rapid, can include attachments and can include additional advisors or collaborators. Email is a very low-cost method of communication, but it isn’t free. Every email sent takes energy to send it, and the bigger the size (especially sizes of attachments), the more electricity is used to send them through your institutional server, or beyond. This is actually a reason why you should not be sending superfluous emails as the bigger they are, the more energy they use. An important point about emails is that they can be kept and/or forwarded to third parties. This means that you are best advised not to include any content that might be considered (by anyone) as risky or contentious. In particular, avoid anything written about any third party, unless you are happy for them to see what you have written. There is also a legal implication in that they can be used in court, for example, if you have written something libellous about a third party. This is true even if you didn’t write the email but simply forwarded the content that someone else wrote. Remember that what is funny to you might be offensive to someone else. 5.1.1 The subject Do include a succinct subject for your email. Do not leave this blank. Remember that your advisor, and other professionals that you communicate with, likely receives many emails in a day. They may not be able to respond to you immediately, but may want to know what the email is about before they open it. The subject is especially important if you need something quickly (e.g. something signed, or for permission). If this is urgent, you might consider saying when the deadline is in the subject line. Obviously, you should avoid making urgent demands from anyone in your professional world, but sometimes this is necessary and everyone will understand. However, if you fail to communicate this in the subject of your email, don’t be surprised if your request is sidelined until after it’s too late. 5.1.2 Writing style In general, it’s best to keep your style brief. If you feel that you need to write a long email, consider ways in which you could better communicate the same information in a meeting, or in responses to comments in a chapter draft. I would discourage you from writing long emails as reading them will tend to take up more of your advisor’s time than other forms of communication. I used to get annoyed with people who insist on starting every email with “I hope this email finds you well” or some such banality. I now understand that this is culturally important for some people who are used to using longer greeting formats and who are genuinely sending a message of well wishing. Some time back, there was an administrator in our small unit who used this in every email that they sent, irrespective of whether we’d just been talking over a coffee or had spent the entire morning in a meeting together. Hence, this overuse of something that could otherwise have been nice to read became irritating. My advice would be that if you do have a personal connection with someone and want to make this clear, then by all means do so. Try to make it personal and not generic. Certainly, refrain from excessive use where any phrase could become meaningless or irritating There are whole books on how to write emails (e.g. Taylor, 2009), so I’m not going to go into too much detail here. Suffice it to say that just like any other form of communication: try to make the reason why you are communicating clear read through what you’ve written before you press send try not to be overly familiar or informal (Lewin-Jones &amp; Mason, 2014) be polite, as this may make a difference to you getting a positive response (Bolkan &amp; Holmgren, 2012) let brevity be your watchword 5.1.2.1 Don’t use slang or SMS language I remember an email that a colleague received (many years ago) asking for a bursary. I don’t remember the exact wording, but it went something like this: “Hey Nanni [her family name] - U gonna give me 1 bursary? I is the best student.” Needless to say, this student didn’t receive a bursary, although they could well have been the best student in their class and fully deserving. Their skills at communication were not sufficient to warrant another look. And while this example may seem ludicrous, it appears that many undergraduate students do correspond with their lecturers in this way (see Stephens, Houser &amp; Cowan, 2009). As with all communication, you need to be focussed more on the recipient and their ability to comprehend the message that you intend. Although I will reiterate that you must keep your emails short, this should not be at the expense of comprehension. 5.1.2.2 Formalities The level of formality that you use will largely depend on your existing relationship with your correspondent. The formal tone is set immediately with the greeting that you use. I am happy for people to start any email with “Hi”, but other advisors might prefer something else. If you are unsure about your advisor, then ask them. As a default, you should use the same style that they are using to address you. When emailing someone that you don’t know, use the most formal style: “Dear Dr. Blogs” or “Dear Prof. Bliggs”. If you don’t know what their rank is, use an appropriate level that you consider likely. Remember that there are conventions in different places (e.g. every academic in the US is a Prof.; in Europe Prof. is reserved for the highest rank only, and everyone else is Dr.). Similarly, when you sign off, use a formal sign off. As a general rule of thumb, you can use how they sign off their email to address them. For example, if I sign off an email “With best wishes, John”, I expect that you will reply with Dear John or Hi John. However, if I sign off “With best wishes, John Measey”, then I am looking for a more formal response starting with “Dear Dr. Measey”. Remember that if you cc in others, you should move your formality accordingly. Bear in mind that emails can be kept or forwarded without your knowledge. You do not want to regret a particularly lax use of formality at a later date. I would suggest that the more people that you address your email to, the more formal you’ll need to be. In general, emails that you write as a postgraduate student are professional communications, so keep them as such. This does not mean that you need to start using citations in your emails, or that you can’t use contractions (like can’t, won’t or didn’t). You emails don’t need to be formal as in the style of a published paper. As with the initial greeting, you should look at emails you receive to see how to set the formality of the tone that you will write. 5.1.3 Why exactly are you communicating? The first two or three sentences of your email should state why you are communicating and whether or not you are expecting a reply. Emails can be just for information, keeping someone up to date on your progress or letting them know that something they asked for has been done. If this is the case, then start your email with a statement letting the recipient know the reason why you are keeping them informed, and that you don’t expect a reply. If you require a response from your recipient concerning a particular question, then you should flag this in the first line of your email. If their response is time sensitive (i.e. you need a reply before a certain date) then state exactly when this is. In the subsequent information that you write in your email, you need to make the question or questions clear. If you need to write a long explanation in your email, then you might want to draw attention to the question that you want answering by making it bold. Another useful means of concentrating your recipients attention is to use structure. 5.1.3.1 Using Structure I like it when people use some structure in their email. If it’s going to be a long email (which I’d advise against) then do include a short summary explanation at the start so that the reader knows what the email is about (especially if the subject line doesn’t fully explain). Using bullet points or numbered points in the email is also a great way of using structure, especially when you expect a reply on each point. 5.1.3.1.1 Replying inline This simply means that the previous email is reproduced when you hit reply, often with some marker for what was written originally. I like inline replies as it’s simple to see that each point has been addressed. It’s also a useful way to be reminded of what was originally written. Some email chains start to become a bit tedious when many inline responses make them so cluttered that it’s hard to see what’s going on any more. Use your common sense to decide when it’s enough. 5.1.3.1.2 HTML emails or plain text Most email software now defaults to emails written in HTML, which means that you can use bold, italics, bullet points and most other features that you would in a word processing package. Some people prefer plain text only, but HTML is becoming more standard. 5.1.3.1.3 Email chain Most email software has an option to include the original message in the reply. This is quite useful in that it can remind everyone about what was asked. As these kinds of conversations get longer, they can become very large and unwieldy. 5.1.3.1.4 Bullet pointed or numbered lists I think that both of these are appropriate when you have a number of points that you’d like addressed. 5.1.3.2 Use of all Capital Letters - DON’T DO THIS!!!! When reading any email when parts are written in All Caps, this comes across as someone who is shouting (see use in subheading). Not something that you should be doing in any professional communication. If you need to, then use bold or italics to emphasise points. Similarly, I’d appeal for you not to use excessive exclamation points, slang (especially swearing) or other such frivolities in your professional email. It’s simply not a way of communication that you should be doing at work. Write emails to your friends like this if you want to, but I’d suggest that you do this from a private email account (and not your institutional address). 5.1.4 Signing off How is it best to sign off? Most professional emails sign off with one of the following: With best wishes Kind regards All the best Any of these is fine to use, as are the more formal classic letter writing “Yours faithfully” or “Yours sincerely”. I quite like it when people sign off using their own language, as it (somehow) makes it more personal and sincere. I have worked in a number of countries around the world, and when there tried to use local language words to start and end emails. 5.1.5 Who else should your email be sent to? You may need to send emails to more than one recipient. If you are planning to send an email to a lot of recipients, then it might be worth checking this with your advisor first. You will also need to decide whether the recipients should be listed in the To box, CC or BCC. If the email is sent to someone, then their name should be listed in the initial greeting: “Dear Drs. Bliggs and Blogs” 5.1.6 When to CC someone Only Carbon Copy (CC) someone if there is a real need for them to be included on the email. In reality, multiple addresses can be added in the To field, and anyone that the email is written to should be listed there. In the business world, a lot of email correspondence includes the entire team in CC. This is usually not needed for academia. If you are in any doubt about whether or not to include someone in CC, then ask your advisor. If you do put someone additional in CC, then it is polite to note this in the email. For example, in the initial salutation you could write “Dear Sue and Bob (and Warren in CC)…” I like to indicate the reason for including someone in CC at the appropriate point in the body of the email. This lets everyone know exactly why they have been CC’d.  “Dear Sue and Bob, I am writing regarding the delivery of the 33 g steel ball that Warren (in CC) and I ordered on 12th November this year.” Or “Dear Drs. Bliggs and Blogs (Prof. Blab in cc)” Remember that someone in CC will be in CC again if the person you are writing to hits Reply All. 5.1.6.1 Use of BCC Blind Carbon Copy (BCC) is a very useful way of copying in another person without the original person or anyone in CC knowing. But you should use this feature of email with extreme care. Many people who receive an email in BCC are not immediately aware, and it has happened to me that people I have BCC’d have then hit “Reply All” and immediately disclosed their presence on the email. This is very embarrassing. Thus I would urge you to only use this when the person you intend to BCC is aware of the fact. A common use of BCC is when emails are sent to a great number of people and to avoid having anyone use Reply All. If you have a great number of collaborators (for example on a literature review or a large author list), then you can address the email to yourself (or your advisor) and BCC everyone else. Note that if someone is on BCC, then they won’t get included when any of the rest of the group (addressee and CC) hit Reply All. 5.1.7 Reply or Reply All? Hitting Reply All instead of Reply is perhaps one of the most common mistakes that I see with email. Some email software has Reply All as the default option whenever you hit reply. If yours does this, I’d urge you to change it immediately. The use of emails to large numbers of recipients is common (especially in companies), but it gets extremely annoying when half of this list hits Reply All just to confirm receipt or even worse give some inane chatty response. If you are going to use Reply All, before you send the email check: that it is appropriate everyone on the list receives your reply that there is not inappropriate information in the email chain that you have added the correct attachment If you have an email inbox that serves multiple email addresses, then it is worth noting that when you hit Reply or Reply All, the default is for it to send from the address that the email was sent to. You can change this default, or you may want to change from (for example) gmail to your institutional address. 5.1.8 Institutional or personal email addresses As a student at your institution, you will likely be allocated an institutional email address. You probably also have your own private email addresses (e.g. Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo, etc.). Some institutions have great problems with their mail servers, and many academics will abandon their use of their institutional email address because it causes too much trouble for them. It is worth asking your advisor which address they would like you to use (if you know that they have several). However, I would suggest that you make use of the institutional address for all formal communication so that you have a record of due diligence should you need it. 5.1.8.1 High Importance Some email software has the ability to flag an email as important. Avoid using this unless you have something with real importance, like some decision or response needed that same day. Otherwise, try not to use this feature. 5.1.8.2 Urgent emails Sometimes it is necessary to communicate urgently. Deadlines are unforgiving and your advisor and other people are not always aware of when they are or what they mean to you. Deadlines are also very stressful, and you might be more prone to miscommunicating or making mistakes. If you need to communicate urgently by email, then here are some tips about how to get a swift response: Urgent for whom? I think it’s worth starting by asking yourself why exactly this message is urgent, and for whom. It could be that this is only urgent for you and your deadline, or it could be that this is a shared urgency among you and the people you are corresponding with. Alternatively, the urgency might not be for you and only for the other person/people. Starting out knowing this information is important as it will help you set the tone for the message. State that it is urgent in the subject: Start the subject with “Urgent” and give a timeline by when you need an answer in the subject line. Most people will receive their emails on their phones and at some point they will see the subject line without reading the contents. If the subject line can inform them of what the topic is and when the urgency is for (e.g., Urgent: signature needed in the next 2 hours, the next 2 days, the next 2 weeks, etc.), this will really help them knowing exactly what is needed. Within the message, provide the explanation again together with a clear and concise account of exactly what needs to be done. If you need a signature, then remember the attachment that needs to be signed. The more concise you can be about what is needed, the faster it is likely to be done. Follow up with an instant message or text. If this is urgent and especially if it is outside office hours, then follow up with an instant message to check that they have received your message. See section on texting below. Before you send the email, take a few moments to read it through and check that everything is correct. If it really is urgent, then the last thing you need is to have some to and fro over the actual meaning of what is written. Some deadlines are really important, and some correspondents are famously late with responses. In this case, consider providing a deadline one or two days earlier than the actual deadline. This only works when you have a couple of weeks to go, but it might help you build in more time and reduce the urgency. For example, you can use the Send Later feature to send a couple of reminders building up the the date. But remember to cancel them if you get what you need before! 5.1.8.3 Sending emails outside office hours Personally, I have no problem with people sending emails whenever they want, as long as they don’t expect replies to come out of office hours. I have often noted that chapter drafts appear in my inbox late on a Friday night. My suggestion to students is that this is not a good use of their time. Rather keep the draft and read it later on Sunday evening themselves after having left it alone for the weekend. You are more likely to spot errors and improve your own writing this way. It will certainly be better than it sitting untouched in my inbox all weekend. If you don’t know whether or not you will get back to your draft on Sunday evening, this would be a great time to use the send later feature. 5.1.8.4 Send Later This is a new feature on many pieces of email software that I really like. Essentially, it allows you to compose an email and stipulate the time and date that you want it to be sent. I find this very handy if I know that someone is on leave. I’d prefer that my email not sit in their backlog, but arrive once they are back from being away and have already cleared their inbox. Another scenario that I use for send later is when I have a deadline, but am awaiting feedback. I can make sure that I meet the deadline by sending the email with report or manuscript attachment or whatever it is that I have to send before the deadline. However, if at the 11th hour I get the feedback from the third party that I’m hoping to include, I can still find the email with report (it’s usually in the Draft folder), make any amendments and then send it off. 5.1.8.5 Forwarding emails One of the most common ways of emails being inappropriately shared is when they are forwarded, or additional people are added to a reply much later in an email chain. I have received many emails where the sender was clearly unaware of what the chain contained. In general, it’s not often appropriate to forward emails to others. 5.1.9 Out of Office autoreply I find the autoreply saying that someone is away very useful. It lets you know whether or not to expect a reply, and might mean that you then write to someone else instead. If setting your own Out of Office autoreply: - Do include the date when you will be back (and check that it’s correct when you send it) - Do state whether you are on holiday or in the field - If there is another means of reaching you (when you aren’t on holiday) then give this Becase you don’t know who will receive your autoreply, make it formal and polite. 5.1.10 Using email signatures and banners An email signature is a useful way of explaining who you are at the end of your email. I find them very useful sources of information like websites, telephone numbers, physical locations (i.e. address). They can also include more information. For example, my signature currently contains a list of journals that I edit for and links to this (and other) books. For this reason, signatures are useful, especially on first contact. Thereafter, signatures don’t really need to be sent with replies and in email chains. Most email software contains options for when signatures are sent. Some institutions will automatically add a pictorial banner to the bottom of every email sent, advertising how great they are. Others will add long legal statements with disclaimers. Obviously, you will have little power over whether or not these are included by your institution. However, some students create and add their own banners to their emails. I would discourage this simply because it takes more energy to send, and uses up considerably more space than text only signatures. 5.1.11 Using emails as a record of due diligence For students that are having problems with their advisor, especially with lack of communication, or non-communication, email provides a very important record to document your due diligence, as well as being able to document your advisor’s lack of timely response (hopefully you already have a student-advisor agreement to refer to). Make sure that you use your institutional email address and the institutional address of your advisor. If they prefer another address, use this in cc in addition to their institutional address. The reason for this is that if you are going to use this paper trail to document your communication, you will need to produce these emails for your institution and they may only consider emails that have been sent using their services. If you suspect that you may need to use your emails in this way in the future, it is worth re-reading them, prior to sending them, and think about how they could be interpreted by a third party. If you are communicating with your advisor on a web based platform (like Slack, WhatsAPp or WeChat), then do you need to send them emails as well? In most institutions, postgraduate students and advisors sign agreements before they start working together. These agreements are likely to come along with deliverables that may include progress reports and chapter drafts. It is well worth looking at this agreement and see what you’ve signed up to. I would maintain that at any point that your agreement states that you need to ‘communicate’ with your advisor, this should be done via email. Similarly, if the agreement talks about you needing to send thesis drafts, do these via email. As stated above, emails are useful because they can be traced, and institutional emails especially so. If either party claims that they ‘did no receive’ an email, this can be independently verified. If you sent something via Slack and at some point your advisor claimed that you didn’t, how do you verify this later? Of course, everyone hopes that there won’t be a breakdown in communication during your studies. However, it’s worth starting your professional career as you mean to go on. 5.1.12 Keeping emails There is a vast array of options when it comes to keeping emails. I know people who consistently keep an empty inbox and do not keep anything. I know other people who keep everything. Some people put every email they received (or send) into a folder. Others keep them all in the inbox (ok - I’m the only person I know who does this). Many institutional email servers will have a limit of what you can keep. These days it can be quite large (e.g. 1 TB). So should you keep all correspondence? I would say that it is worth keeping anything that relates to deliverables that you have. 5.1.13 Institutional Policies Your institution is very likely to have a policy on email use. If you are unsure and there is no summary available to you from your department, you can ask for a copy of the policy to see what is officially allowed and what is prohibited. 5.1.13.1 Folders I like to use tags to group particular subject areas together. I see no point in using folders for people as any search for a person can quickly recover all emails from someone. I find that after 2 years, most correspondence is no longer useful. There is the odd occasion when I delve further back in time, but older institutional emails get archived after 2 years. 5.2 Use of WeChat or WhatsApp during your PhD studies WeChat and WhatsApp are two social media direct messaging apps that currently dominate the markets in Southeast Asia and the rest of the world, respectively. In terms of their potential to communicate during your PhD, they have some similarities which I will outline first, and some differences which I will treat later (see here). Other platforms, such as Slack might be used in particular labs. These can be highly efficient ways of communicating with groups. Just like emails, these social messaging apps can be kept and archived. This means that you can use them as a means of documenting due diligence. Make sure that you have your advisor’s consent to do this. They, or your institutional policies, may insist that you inform them in an email. It is important to bear in mind that these social media apps can have an adverse effect on your mental health (Montag, Becker &amp; Gan, 2018), and even become addictive (Hou et al., 2017). If you think that you need help because you are spending too much time checking your social media apps, then please get in touch with your university’s psotgraduate student support. 5.2.1 Direct messaging It may be appropriate and acceptable to use a messaging app to communicate directly with your advisor. For example, if you have an urgent request. Many of the points discussed above also apply here, and some are even more relevant: Although a message may be received instantly, this does not mean that your advisor (or any other academic) may have the time to respond to you immediately. You need to give people time to respond. In particular this is especially important in evenings, weekends and holiday periods. As there is an expectation that direct messaging receives a quick answer, please try to avoid sending direct messages outside of office hours - unless this has been specifically sanctioned If you are new at communicating with your advisor, ask them whether they prefer to use direct messaging over email. Having someone’s direct messaging details means that you can call them and speak to them directly on their mobile device. Ask permission in the chat before you do this. If you are communicating with your advisor, ask them specifically about whether they are happy with this type of communication - don’t just assume it’s ok. Rather like email, it is possible to forward content from WeChat and WhatsApp to other uses. Be sure that this is appropriate and sanctioned before doing so. Alternatively, assume that everything that is shared with you is confidential unless you are given specific permission to share. Do remember to be polite and thankful when people help you through direct messages. 5.2.2 Group messaging In general, I would advise to learn the unwritten rules of the group through observation over time. Here are some issues that I have come across with student messaging groups. Many students love to use gifs to display their emotions. I would suggest that this is inappropriate in most instances for two reasons: first they take up a lot of space and demand that anyone trying to catch up needs to scroll through a lot more content; second they are designed to be distracting and that is not the aim of communicating in these groups. Keep your messages on topic. Because every message that you (or anyone else) sends on this group platform will send a notification to all subscribers, it is important that you keep any messages that you send relevant to everyone in the group. Avoid sending messages that are about social events (e.g. party invites) unless this has already been sanctioned and (importantly) everyone is invited. 5.2.2.1 In your postgraduate classes Joining a group for your class may be mandatory in some institutions, or at the very least the only way in which you will learn about tasks and deadlines for postgraduate classes. Some postgraduate classes are experimenting with platforms that are only mediated through groups, such as Problem-Based Learning (Luo et al., 2021). In these instances you will have to use the app. Before you post a question on the group, make sure that someone hasn’t just already asked the same question. Use the search functions and see if there’s anything that you have missed. In your classes, it would be inappropriate to add someone who isn’t in the class to the group. This might be seen as being nosey or snooping on class discussions. If you are in doubt about what can and cannot be done in a class group, consult your lecturer or ask your class rep to consult them. 5.2.2.2 In your lab groups Your lab group may also have a group messaging. Generally, these are extremely efficient ways to disseminate information to a group. Be aware of the general issues with these platforms and make sure that if you want to try to do something new on your lab group, have the blessing of your advisor or senior lab member before posting. If your group message is intended for one person in particular, then rather don’t bring it to the entire group. In the same way, if someone has what you believe to be inappropriate behaviour in the lab try to take this problem to the lab PI or bring it up in a lab meeting (as appropriate) rather than posting about it in the group. Calling out bad behaviour in a chat group is sometimes counter-productive and can be upsetting for many lab members. 5.2.3 Desktop versions Both WeChat and WhatsApp have desktop versions of their platforms, and these may replace the use of email in some places. For example, in China WeChat has almost entirely replaced email in many institutions such that sending an email may elicit no response as the inbox is simply not checked. Note that this is not the case in Europe, North America and elsewhere. Institutions may well specifically forbid the official use of social media apps for official communications, so be aware of the policies at your institution. 5.2.4 Turning off notifications It is understandable that you (and others) in a group chat will want to turn off notifications if their mobile devices are pinging too often. If you do turn off your notifications for important class or lab groups, make sure that you look through the content at least once a day (excepting holidays). 5.2.5 Differences There are some important differences between WeChat and WhatsApp. At the time of writing, these differences are diminishing. 5.2.5.1 WeChat WeChat has become a platform that offers far more than messaging and calls (Montag, Becker &amp; Gan, 2018). You can do a lot more on it, as it effectively works as a browser. Thus within your WeChat postgraduate class group, there may be scope to include parts of the learning onto the app. All of this makes it more likely that WeChat will be used as a part of your learning experience. Indeed, there is even evidence that using WeChat responsibly for knowledge sharing at work promotes creativity (Zhang et al., 2021). Another important difference is that WeChat is often linked to someone’s bank card and so can be used for transferring cash. Although this seems unlikely to be used in your PhD situation, always take care when doing this and find out before hand whether WeChat evidence for payments can be used for accounting purposes in your institution. 5.2.5.2 WhatsApp At the moment, WhatsApp does not have the extended uses of the WeChat platform. Having someone’s WhatsApp contact details means that you will have their mobile phone number (or at least the one used for their account which may not be the SIM in their phone). Use this information with respect and don’t share it with third parties unless you have consent. 5.3 Other Social Media platforms During your PhD studies you may make use of other social media platforms to communicate such as Atlmetrics (e.g., see Measey, 2022). As ever, use social media with caution and professionally. Respect the rights of you advisor and lab mates to have their own private social media, just as you may well have your own.

"],["useR.html", "Chapter 6 Upskilling 6.1 When to invest your time in learning a new skill 6.2 And learning lots of other stuff", " Chapter 6 Upskilling Some 30 odd years ago, as an undergraduate, I was told that I would have to use computers in one of my 2nd year courses. The thought filled me with dread and I remember putting off going into the computer room for as long as I could. It was a steep learning curve, and I struggled. As my only previous experience had been with a typewriter, each time the cursor got to the end of the screen I hit the ‘carriage-return’ button. And each machine had an odd white device attached called a mouse, and I had no idea what that did. All this seems quite preposterous now, but imagine embarking on a PhD in biological sciences without reconciling yourself to using a computer. It is obvious now that in order to conduct your work you are going to need skills in lots of tools. Some of these tools will be niche, but others will be universal and extend beyond your thesis into your world after graduating. The message of this chapter is that you may well find that there are skills that you need to learn during your PhD studies that you feel some initial aversion to. You may have a physical aversion to, for example, using a pipette in a lab or dissecting a euthanised animal. Or this could be some kind of skill such as programming in R or Python. Reconciling yourself to learning new skills, even when you have an aversion, will be something that you come across time and again in life, and not just while you are doing a PhD. Because doing a PhD is a time-limited goal orientated process, you will need to quickly overcome your aversion and ulimtately this will help you in future life. 6.1 When to invest your time in learning a new skill Early adopters can either end up putting in a lot of effort and then finding that their effort is misplaced, or finding that they are ahead of the curve and that everyone else needs to catch up. Knowing whether or not to invest your time in learning a new skill is difficult. I suggest that you try to find out more about exactly how much time you might need to invest, and exactly how wide or narrow this new skill might be of use in the future. If your advisor tells you that you must learn this particular tool or skill, then you need to reconcile yourself to doing it. Remember that learning a new skill gives you more than that particular talent. Learning skills helps your brain become more flexible and adaptable to learning in the future (Chang, 2014). Whatever aversion you may have to learning this new skill, you will need to approach it with professionalism, and put aside any prejudice that you may have. Use your time management skills to carve a small piece out of every day to learning your new skill. This starts with being aware when in the day you learn best, and being aware of all the other commitments you have together with how this one will rank. 6.1.1 Example: Learning to write code in R In the early 2000s, R (R Core Team (2024)) was relatively unknown, but a few pioneering individuals had spotted the advantage to using it in their own work (especially to help with repeatability). For those early adopters I am sure that their investment in learning R has paid off. If you are not already aware of the prominence that R now has in conducting statistical analyses in biological sciences, then you’ve missed out on a great deal. The real point here is not that you can use R, but that R represents a platform on which analyses can be easily repeated, and by saving and making the code available together with your data, you are making your data analyses reproducible. We will see elsewhere the importance of reproducibility in sciences (Baker, 2016), and the critical role this has in transparency and, therefore, best practice. What is perhaps most remarkable about learning R is the freedom it gives you away from large amounts of commercial software. As a basic programming language it can be used for statistical analysis, drawing figures, conducting geographic information system (GIS) level work, and even as a word processor on which to write your thesis (and indeed this book Xie, 2016). If you already know all of the above, then you won’t face any major barriers, and you will fit into the new and more transparent world of science with great ease. If the thought of using R fills you with dread, in the same way that using a computer did for me some 30 years ago, then you should reconcile yourself now before you go any further. Learning R will be a steep learning curve, but it will be made easier by the large amount of excellent video tutorials and online courses that are available. 6.2 And learning lots of other stuff The same principle that I’ve written about above can be extended to all sorts of other aspects of your PhD project. You will have to learn new skills, and some of these will be things that you have previously resisted having to do. Allow yourself to be open to all aspects of learning, and all skills. The act of learning opens new pathways in your brain, and using this ‘muscle’ will facilitate future learning exercises.

Although deadlines don’t work for everyone. Douglas Adams famously claimed: “I love deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by.” Problems arise when we become overwhelmed by stress and are unable to fully respond. When this occurs, productivity can drop off and survival responses can be triggered as if responding to an actual physical attack. These responses include fight, flight or freeze responses. Anxiety and panic can be triggered. In this state, additional demands on your time may also push your life off balance, so that you start to neglect your personal well-being which can negatively impact on relationships, exercise regime, or even nutrition and personal hygiene. Some people can find that the additional stress can cause physical symptoms that may even need medical treatment (see Zhong et al., 2019). Your sense of competence and mastery can be negatively impacted such that you may even suffer from feelings of inadequacy or imposter syndrome (see part 2). These types of pressure tend to be low at the start, and increase during your time as a postgraduate student (Cheng et al., 2020). Although there are not many studies on mental wellbeing for PhD students, those that exist (as well as surveys: Nature 2019) all suggest that there is a significant toll, which is proportionately higher than for others in society (Levecque et al., 2017). Whatever your prior experience of stress in a working environment, academia is known to be particularly stressful, and as a PhD student, you are likely to absorb a significant amount of this stress into your own life (Stubb, Pyhältö &amp; Lonka, 2011; Cheng et al., 2020). 7.1 General Health Questionnaire The General Health Questionnaire (see GHQ-12 in Table 7.1) is an instrument used to measure psychological distress. It is quick, reliable and simple to score, so you can use it at any time during your PhD studies as an indicator of whether you need to reach out to personal, occupational or professional support networks. Right now, I suggest you complete the GHQ-12 (Table 7.1) and record your answers as a baseline. Keep the scores somewhere safe. During the course of your PhD, if you feel that your scores may have changed, take the test again and compare them with your baseline scores. Although there are no hard rules, if three or more of your scores have moved by two or more points it could be worth discussing with your support network to help you decide whether or not to seek professional help. TABLE 7.1: A General Health Questionnaire with 12 questions (GHQ-12) that you can use to keep track of your mental wellbeing. Answer the questions in this table now, and compare your answers to answers in your future when you are feeling more under strain. Write down any explanations you have for your choice of answers.

Better than usual Same as usual Less than usual Much less than usual Even if you don’t feel you need the support of your institution now, it is worth finding out how they can support your mental wellbeing in the future if needed. Although there has been some stigma attached to difficulties with mental wellbeing in the past, most institutions accept that pressures are mounting on postgraduate students and that they may require support. Most institutions have experienced councillors available to support you if needed. Importantly, you should realise that none of these symptoms are unusual and that there is a high probability that many of your colleagues may also be struggling. Knowing that your problems are shared and reaching out to support networks early is an excellent way to prevent them from escalating beyond your control. A study into the mental wellbeing of PhD students in Belgium exemplifies the kinds of difficulties that they face when compared with other similar groups (Levecque et al. (2017); Figure 7.1). FIGURE 7.1: How does the mental wellbeing of people in different sectors compare? A comparison of the mental wellbeing of PhD students (data from Levecque et al., 2017) with highly educated general population, highly educated employees and higher education students using the General Health Questionnaire. The Risk Ratio (RR: adjusted for age and gender) in PhD students in Flanders, Belgium, is consistently higher (&gt;1) when compared to any of the other surveyed groups. No matter how well you think of your own abilities to cope with mental wellbeing issues, doing a PhD will cause you additional stress and can trigger maladaptive coping mechanisms. Learning how to cope with additional stress early in your career can be beneficial for future personal development. Academia is recognised as a particularly stressful environment; you will likely take on some of this environmental stress in addition to any stress associated with your studies. Additional stressors come from home and family situations. Your best means of coping will be to try and develop a support network and to understand where and with whom you can discuss any difficulties as they arise. Knowing who this is and how and when to approach them will put you in a stronger position if you need them in future. 7.2 Support network The people in your life make up your support network. Each person will have a different role, and not everyone in your support network will be able to support your mental wellbeing. For example, some of your colleagues at work might be in your support network for using equipment or doing statistics, but you may find that these same people do not necessarily understand you as a person. People in your support network for your mental wellbeing are likely to consist of your close friends, family and those colleagues at work that you find a special connection with (i.e. new friends). You should identify your support network, and even place a tag next to their name in your contacts. Once you know who they are, you should also let them know that they are important to you, and that you may in future come to them to discuss issues around your mental wellbeing during your PhD studies in the future. It is important that they know that they have this role for you, and more often than not you can offer to fulfil this role for them in a reciprocal manor. During the course of your PhD, you should make sure that you take the time to check-in with your support network and let them know how things are going. This means sharing the good times as well as the bad times with them. If the only contact you make with them is when things get really bad, you are likely to find that they don’t have a sufficient connection with you to help get you back on track. When you make contact with people in your support network, don’t forget that they also require support from you. Inquire about how they are doing and be prepared to spend time sharing your respective highs and lows. On each occasion that you invest time in your support network it will grow that relationship and deepen the level of mutual support that you can hope to receive when you need it. 7.3 Being physically active improves mental wellbeing The positive relationship between the amount of physical activity and higher mental well-being is well established (e.g. Gerber et al., 2014; Grasdalsmoen et al., 2020), but the kind of exercise required to achieve this improved result is varied. For example, a study of college students showed that an hour of Thai Chi twice a week for 3 months was enough to have significantly improved physical and mental wellbeing scores (Wang et al., 2004). Increased levels of physical activity were also found to be associated with improved sleep quality in another study (Gerber et al., 2014; Ghrouz et al., 2019). There are plenty of studies out there that suggest there are multiple benefits from physical activity. If you don’t do it already, then when you start your PhD also start regular exercise. Getting fit was the best thing I ever did to improve my work. The first thing I found was that I could sit and concentrate on work for longer. Before I got fit, I was constantly distracted and needed to take lots of breaks. Now I find that my concentration is much better and that as my fitness stamina increases, so too does my ability to concentrate. It is important to note that exercise is not about creating some perfect body image that you might see on social media. A useful tool to help think about the importance of exercise for your body came from from Stutz and Michels’ (2022) Life Force model in which they proposed that your life force is equivalent to a pyramid. The bottom of the pyramid represents your relationship with your body which is equivalent to 85% of the life force pyramid area (Figure 7.2). Working on this component consists of sleep, diet and exercise. The second part of this pyramid has your relationships with other people, both personal and in your work context. Lastly, your mental wellbeing (your relationship with yourself) sits atop these other components and is supported by them. Working on the lower components of the pyramid will support your mental wellbeing, but you can also work directly on your mental wellbeing through, for example, mindfulness and meditation. Stutz goes on to explain that writing is a way to enhance your relationship with yourself. This might explain why some people find writing their thesis a very positive experience, but also gives us another way in which we can think about writing and ourselves. FIGURE 7.2: A model to understand the importance of your body in connection to your mental wellbeing. In this model from Stutz and Michels (2022) you see the body taking up 85% of the area of the pyramid, on which rests your relationships with other people and finally your mental wellbeing on top. Maintaining your mental wellbeing therefore rests on your body receiving enough sleep, a good diet and exercise. 7.4 Valuing your sleep Sleep is often underrated. But sleep research is showing us just how critical good sleep is for our health, including our mental wellbeing and many other aspects of what we are trying to achieve during our time spent not sleeping (Walker, 2017; Ramar et al., 2021). For example, student symptoms of anxiety and depression are commonly associated with poor sleeping habits including sleep that is too short or irregular sleeping hours (Becker et al., 2018a). Sleep is a biological necessity, and insufficient sleep and untreated sleep disorders are detrimental for health, well-being, and public safety. Kumar et al. (2021) My point here is that you do not only need sleep for your general wellbeing, but it is also vital when you are studying, particularly during your PhD, as this is the time that your brain will be making and reorganising the connections between neurons to make sense of the day’s information (MacDonald &amp; Cote, 2021; Miao et al., 2023).Hence, you need sleep in order to process what you have learned during the day. This is especially important for your critical reading and regular writing, because it is during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep that the connections between what you read and what you write will be made. This is why it is often a good idea to have some time between your first and second drafts of written work, because you will have the time to reflect and REM sleep to consolidate connections that were not previously there. Keeping a notebook and pen by your bed could bring great rewards. Because you become concious of ideas and potential solutions between different sleep phases, it’s a great idea to have a notebook handy to jot these down. This has two functions, it will stop you obsessing about the idea and potentially losing sleep and ensure that you do not forget potentially useful ideas. Note that not every idea that you have is going to be a winner. But they are all worth keeping and considering the next day. Although it’s tempting to use your phone to capture such ideas, you should be aware that night-time use of screens is linked to sleep problems (Mireku et al., 2019), and could also distract you (with notifications) away from getting the sleep you need. If you didn’t realise already, you need to be aware that regular sleeping with adequate duration is necessary in order to stimulate the REM sleep that you need to process all of the information that you take in during the day. That’s not to say that you can’t attend parties that go on late into the night - these are important too. But the majority of your nights should be spent getting sufficient and regular sleep. Good sleep will improve your studies, your mental wellbeing and your ability to take on the challenges of your PhD. If you are experiencing difficulty sleeping, then there are many potential causes, and you can find out more here or watch this video. Happily, there are many things that you can change that will improve your chances of getting better sleep. You would do well to consider the 5 principles for good sleep health (Espie, 2022): Value your sleep - recognise it for the importance that it has in your non-sleeping life. Prioritise your sleep - a regular sleeping pattern (time and duration) will produce better sleep. Personalise your sleep - the right sleep for you might be different for someone else and will change throughout your life. - Trust your sleep - will work for you and help you with your working day. The results of a good night’s sleep are not always evident in the short-term, but trust that they will bring you many benefits in the long-term. Protect your sleep - from degradation by keeping work and worries away from your sleeping environment. I cannot stress strongly enough how beneficial good sleep is to your mental wellbeing, your PhD studies and your life in general. 7.5 Time to think I used to think that the time I spent exercising was unproductive with respect to work. Now I have begun to realise that this represents some of my best thinking time. I use the time I spend trail running to turn ideas over in my head and especially to think through the logic in arguments, and potential flaws in experimental design. This isn’t to say that I don’t need to put time in at the computer writing it all down, or talking through ideas with colleagues. But I find the meditative time I spend exercising to be especially productive. Don’t take my word for it, see this great book by Caroline Williams (2021). In this book it is emphasised that exercise might not mean sport, but simply taking a walk or another aspect of self propelled movement. Actively seek out the activities that work best for you in order to think or reflect. Once you know what they are, plan to use them to optimise your thinking time. 7.5.1 Mindfulness Mindfulness is the practice of bringing one’s attention to the present moment, being fully aware of thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and the surrounding environment. Mindfulness has been growing in prominence in the 21st century often eclipsing the more traditional practice of meditation. Although meditation and mindfulness share many techniques and benefits, the latter benefits from being able to conduct it anywhere and in any state and does not require specific time or space. For example, mindfulness can be practiced when walking home from work, washing the dishes or eating your lunch, while meditation usually involves a specific quiet environment and sometimes particular physical positions. The benefits of meditation are widely appreciated and have found their way into most mainstream spiritual practices. In a meta-analysis, mindfulness was shown to have measurable effects on reducing stress, have moderate effects on anxiety, depression, distress and quality of life (Khoury et al., 2015). Moreover, this positive impact of mindfulness has been shown in very short training periods of as little as four days (Zeidan et al., 2010). Mindfulness training is associated with structural and functional changes in the amygdala, a brain region involved in emotional regulation (Hölzel et al., 2010), also helping to reduce repetitive negative thinking (Jain et al., 2007). People practicing mindfulness have been shown to have greater attention spans and better working memory (Jha, Krompinger &amp; Baime, 2007; Mrazek et al., 2013). If you want to try mindfulness, or more formal meditation, there are many self-help books and other internet resources available. You can start by exploring these resources here, here and here. 7.6 Balancing work with life Having already told you that doing a PhD might unbalance you mentally, regular exercise is a really good way to make sure that you retain that balance with life (see Hotaling, 2018). By life, I’m referring to everything away from your academic work. This might include family, friends, sport, hobbies (even fishing). If you don’t have friends outside your academic life, then it would be a good idea to find some so that you can keep in contact with the ‘real world’. There are some extremely unhealthy workplace cultures around that encourage students to work from early until late, implying that unless you are seen at your desk that you cannot be productive. I have worked in these places and found them to be unproductive environments. If you are in such an environment, then you should be particularly careful about balancing work with life. You could find a role model who is living a better balanced working life, or push through with your own more balanced routine. When others around you see that you are more productive despite spending less time at your desk, you might be able to shift the culture into something that improves life for everyone. Non-working time (e.g., holiday time) is also important in order to keep you productive during your PhD. You should not be working every day from beginning to end. Try to save at least one day every week work-free so that you can rest and spend time with friends and/or relatives. During busy times you might have to sacrifice this day, especially when you are working in the field or attending a conference. But you should make up this shortfall when times are less busy. You also need a real holiday when you take a break from your PhD work altogether at least twice every year. It can be hard to switch between work and non-work time, and being able to do this will take practice. Because the period of your PhD is normally very intense, finding ways in which to make this shift and practising them will be a critical skill that you’ll be able to carry with you throughout your life. One suggestion is to finish your working time, whether this is when you leave your desk at the end of the day or just before you go on holiday, by regularly spending a final 10 minutes to list down the ideas and points that need attention when you come back to work. You could think of this as a shutdown routine, in the same way that you shut down your computer you are also shutting down your working time and switching into non-working time. By practising this technique, you will teach yourself how to switch from working into non-working modes. The great advantage of this technique is that you can combine it with your day-to-day time management planning so that these tasks and ideas fit appropriately into your scheduled activities and don’t impinge on your established working routine. If you already exercise, then you likely know how important this is. But if you don’t then, my best advice (above anything else that you might read in this book) is to start as soon as you can. Do whatever is right for you. If you don’t already know, then try out different clubs or activities at your institution. There are normally lots to choose from. Make sure that you schedule regular time for your activity, even if that means that you run in the mornings before field work starts, or you spend your evenings doing tai-chi on the beach after a day at sea doing research on dolphins. Take your exercise with you wherever you go for your studies. Take it as seriously as you do your studies and you’ll find that both will benefit.

Note that here and elsewhere I refer to this person as an advisor and not a supervisor (see here). If this person were your supervisor, then it would be their project and you would be under their supervision. Instead, the reality is that your PhD is your project and they are providing you with advice. This chapter aims to provide you with advice on navigating the student-advisor relationship. Over the course of your PhD, you will likely work closely with this person. You may well see them every day. I hope that you will share the ups and downs of your project together, and ultimately the success of getting your PhD, and publishing your results. Because there is so much importance wrapped up in this relationship, you do need to approach it with some care and professionalism. Of particular note is the inherent power imbalance in your relationship, making it different from many other types of relationships. Hopefully, there will be no problems for you at all, but it is worth making provision for problems from the outset because problems between advisors and their PhD students are not uncommon. I hope that this chapter will provide you with enough information to start and continue your relationship with your advisor on the best terms possible. In this chapter, I am going to assume that you have already chosen your advisor. Earlier, in Part 1, I explained what to look for in an advisor. Once you have started your PhD studies, it is unlikely that you will have the option to change advisors easily, so this chapter will focus on the dynamics of the relationship with this particular person. 8.1 Expectations One of the most important aspects of the student-advisor relationship is the expectations that each has about what the relationship should be like. For example, if you have already had an advisor for your MSc or undergraduate research project, then as a student, you likely have some experience of what this relationship can be like. However, it is important to remember that, just like elsewhere in life, the relationship you have with your new PhD advisor may not be like the relationship you had with your previous advisor. These expectations are particularly important at the outset of the relationship, as it is during this time that you will make the impressions that guide your advisor onwards. Similarly, your initial impression of your advisor will likely be important for your view of them. From the outset, you need to understand what your expectations should be, and perhaps equally important what they should not be. These ideas are loosely based on several papers on this topic, each of which might be worth your reading if you are looking for different viewpoints and perspectives (Gill &amp; Burnard, 2008; Mainhard et al., 2009; Abdullah &amp; Evans, 2012; Masek, 2017), and you can find them listed under responsibilities. Your advisor should: Support and advise you with your project Have time and space to meet with you to discuss your project. At the start, I would try to make such meetings regularly (e.g. every week or two weeks), so that you can both have some regular regime with clear deliverables Provide a critical appraisal of your ideas and plans: these are both positive and negative, but more important is that they are reasoned feedback with explanations that allow you to understand each comment. At the start of your PhD, many of your meetings are going to be about planning and the practical side of doing the work ahead. Your advisor should have experience in these aspects, or be able to point you where to go, and you will be on a steep learning curve to catch up. Read and comment on written work that you produce. Although this will likely come later in your relationship, you should expect that your advisor is willing to read and comment on what you have written and that this is done within an agreed time frame. If you have regular meetings, then the time between meetings is a logical period for this kind of feedback. There will be lots of caveats here because academics are busy people and some times of the year are especially busy. You will nearly always be the person who needs to remain flexible on timelines, but planning will go a long way toward managing your own expectations here. If you know that there is a deadline for comments a particular piece of written work, like a grant application, then be explicit about this before you hand it in and work with your advisor and their schedule. In my experience, the time taken to read a piece of written work, be it a literature review or a chapter draft, is a common reason for the upset of PhD students. Some difficulties can be ameliorated through meeting notes (see below). As a student you should: Take ownership of your PhD Adhere to the scientific ethic Practice good time-management Communicate effectively Take advice seriously Each of these ideas is discussed in more detail below. 8.1.1 Keep your expectations real Don’t expect that you are going to be best friends with your advisor. It is known that student-advisor relationships that become too friendly are less productive (Hockey, 1995). One of the reasons why advisors don’t become best friends with their students is that often they simply don’t have the time (McCallin &amp; Nayar, 2012). The demands on the time of a typical academic are so great that they likely don’t have much time or energy to take their relationship with you beyond anything professional, even if they wanted to. It may well be that you do form a great friendship, but this will likely only happen if you start with a professional relationship and mutual respect. Relationships take time, and it is important to start professionally. This does not mean that you should be cold, unkind or unfriendly. On the contrary, the best professional relationships include warmth, friendliness and kindness. If you have to have a single watchword for your relationship with your advisor be kind. Try reading the views of Howells et al. (2017), the need-supportive relationships Of Janssen et al. (2021), and the impact of gratitude on the student-advisor relationship or that of Lundgren and Osika (2021) on gratitude. I prefer to ask people to concentrate on kindness, because all of us understand what it means to be kind, and we should all be able to bring kindness with us to our workplaces. 8.1.2 Student-advisor agreements Many departments or faculties have student-advisor agreements that are there to help both parties. They should be modified and signed at the beginning of your PhD time. Take this task seriously. Hopefully you will never need to go back and look at this agreement as your relationship with your advisor will be professional and productive. But in the case of difficulties, you can go back to this and know exactly what was agreed to by both parties, and this may help you judge on whose side the relationship has failed. Having a student-advisor agreement at the start of your PhD can be very useful in future, and if this is not practised in your department, then you may want to suggest adopting a generic one. Even if they don’t like your idea, it might be worth you finding one that you can use with your advisor. This becomes especially important if you think that there could be a potential Conflict of Interest in future. 8.1.3 Other students and postdocs in the group While it is a very good idea for you to have good relationship with everyone in the group, I suggest that it is not a good idea to immediately start asking the opinion of different group members about your shared advisor(usually the group PI). The reason is that each member of the lab will have their own relationship with this person, and this may have little bearing on yours. You will likely hear if there are general observations that people share, but these may not be constructive. Consider how this situation would be in any other relationship forming experience that you have in your life. When you first meet someone that you expect to spend constructive time with, discussing this person with other people that they know is less of a priority than making good impressions and spending time as constructively as possible with that person. For example, if I have a new doubles partner in a tennis competition, I should be most interested in spending time training with them to learn about their strengths, than going to other people in the tennis club and discussing their weaknesses. This is not to say that you should not form a relationship with other people in the group, this will also be an important part of your work dynamic. Just like other relationships in life, you will have individual relationships with others in the group, and then you will have a relationship with the group as a whole. Group dynamics are often very different from relationships you have with individuals in the group. 8.2 Power imbalance Your advisor holds the power to influence your career progress. Navigating the power dynamic between PhD students and their advisors can be challenging, as supervisors typically hold more authority and experience in academia. Many academic institutions still have a hierarchical ethos that the most senior academics should never be questioned. This is clearly problematic from the outset, and if your advisor is a senior academic who has become habituated to this kind of high-power status, then the results for many of their students can be disastrous (Abbott, 2004; see Malaga-Trillo &amp; Gerlach, 2004; but also see Vences &amp; Zardoya, 2004 for alternative viewpoints). Essentially, the situation is very similar to that of bullying, which is quite prevalent in academia (see Measey, 2022). One particular outcome, that is not unique to this situation, is the divide and conquer tactics that are used by some academics whereby they have favoured and non-favoured lab members. My PhD advisor used this against all of the people in his lab so that individuals could be in favour one week, and condemned the next. It was a toxic workplace environment in which this PI was not only our PhD advisor, but also Head of Department and he used this additional power to quash any dissent. Suffice it to say that I am more than aware of what can happen when student-advisor relationships turn bad, and our purpose here is to try to ensure that it never gets that bad. 8.2.1 Relationships between advisors and their students Many institutions forbid any of their staff to have consensual relationships between their staff and students. This is especially true for advisors and their students due to the power imbalance inherent in this relationship. Where these do occur, they can lead directly to conflict within the relationship (see Gunnarsson, Jonasson &amp; Billhult, 2013) and the workplace (Secunda, 2004). According to Gossett and Bellas (2002), when prohibitions on relationships do occur, there are three principle reasons given: The power asymmetry between professor and student The potential for favouritism or nepotism The negative effect on the scholarly environment But the matter remains controversial as noncoercive relationships between professors and students do happen (Gossett &amp; Bellas, 2002). 8.2.2 Conflicts of interest In certain situations, a conflict of interest (CoI) may arise between the student and advisor (see MacDonald &amp; Williams-Jones, 2009). Measey (2022) has covered the issue of CoIs in academic publishing in some detail, and it would be worth reading these examples to get an idea of the potential problems. Several of these examples include conflicts of interest between advisors and students. This is a potentially very serious issue, and I have heard of some truly terrible examples. Sadly, because of the power imbalance inherent in the relationship, it is almost always the student that comes off worst in these situations. The arbitrators in any such disagreement are usually the institution, and they may also be within the same CoI - especially if money is involved. Each situation is likely to be individual, and so it will be difficult to hand out any general advice. However, if you have a signed student-advisor agreement, which includes the issue of a CoI, then you may be able to use this to bolster your case with your institution in the occasion of a disagreement. If your advisor is involved in fraud, then there should be a mechanism within your institution whereby you can report them. You may need to seek advice both inside and outside of your institution before taking this step. 8.3 Communication Communication breakdowns are not unusual between individuals, especially if both parties are under a lot of pressure and stress. You have a responsibility to make your communication as effective as possible. If you are experiencing difficulties in communicating with your advisor, try for more regular meetings with more formal note taking and agreements on deliverables. Make notes at the meeting, deliver these afterwards in the form of an email with the agreed deliverables listed. Bring this with you at the start of the next meeting. Be open and honest about the challenges you’re facing, including difficulties with meeting agreed deliverables. Most advisors will be more than happy to accommodate you if you are clear about what you need in order to finish the task. Remember that your requests have to be realistic, and that you need to be considerate with other demands that your advisor may have on their time. 8.3.1 Cultural differences It is possible, and perhaps even likely, that you and your advisor come from different cultures. Academics are famously mobile and often work in countries and cultures that are not their own. Similarly, students often go overseas to study and so can end up with an advisor that is not from their own culture. Although it is difficult to provide specific guidance here, both parties need to be aware of potential cultural differences. For example, if your culture as a student means that it is inappropriate for you to say “no” to your advisor, if they are from another culture they may not be sensitive to this and think that you are agreeing to everything they suggest. The key will be communication. Communicate as honestly as you can and ask for clarification if you feel that your advisor has been unclear. 8.4 Meetings I suggested above that you arrange to have regular meetings with your advisor, but it is important that you are proactive on what these meetings are about and follow up with notes. Always take your lab notebook (or a special meeting book) with you to the meeting so that you can make notes on the advice given, as well as being able to go back to look at what was agreed last time. As an advisor, I often get frustrated that students come with no notebook to a meeting and instantly forget all the advice they are given, only to return with the same set of issues the following meeting. You should also think about having an agenda for your meeting (a list of points that you need to discuss). I like the idea of having a set meeting agenda where the topics inside it change, but the format is similar from meeting to meeting. You can see an example of this in Table 8.1 TABLE 8.1: A typical agenda for a regular meeting with your advisor. Although the subject of each topic may change for each meeting, the items are likely to follow a standard pattern. Agenda item Examples of what this could consist of Catch up Provide a quick summary of what you have been up to since the last meeting, be sure to emphasise any key realisations (e.g. from your reading) or results (e.g. from experiments). By discussing these insights, it will help you both to align your current thinking on a topic, and quickly get to a more insightful level. This should also be the most lively part of the meeting where you can exchange ideas and get enthusiastic. Tasks agreed during the last meeting Using your notebook, go through the tasks that were agreed (on both sides) and report back on any deliverables. Feedback on work submitted Although feedback will often be given as comments on a piece of writing, it is helpful to get some verbal feedback that might give you a much better overall feeling. It will also allow your advisor to highlight points that they think are particularly important and gloss over others that are less significant. Problems and possible solutions Never put this item first. As an advisor, there’s nothing worse than someone starting a meeting with all their problems. It sets the tone for the meeting and tends to drag it down. Remember that this is your project (and they are only advising) so the problems are yours (not theirs) and they are there to provide advice. Whenever you discuss a problem try to come up with a possible solution, or more than one. It is much easier to provide advice to someone who has already started to think about how to solve it than being expected to come up with a solution. For your part, it will be much more satisfying if your proposed solution turns out to coincide with the best advice. Tasks before the next meeting Remember to make notes on any deliverables that are agreed upon during the meeting. At the end of the meeting, read these out and make sure that you have it right. You are looking for agreement on each of these. Also, ask your advisor if there’s anything extra that they think you’ve missed. In the case that you are struggling with getting feedback on deliverables from your advisor, you may want to write them an email summary of the meeting with the agreed deliverables so that there is a record. You don’t need to start doing this at the outset of your relationship, but after 4 to 6 months you should know if this is needed. Having regular meetings with your advisor will also help you to avoid any competition that there may be for their time. As we saw in the last chapter, there are only a certain number of hours in the day and your advisor is going to want to free themselves from most meeting commitments as possible. This means that you need to keep your meetings, short, productive and enjoyable. 8.5 Responsibilities Knowing who has what responsibilities in your student-advisor relationship is key to avoiding potential troubles. Certainly, in my experience the most misunderstood responsibility is that the student believes (wrongly) that the project that they are doing belongs to their advisor. This failure to take ownership of their work has a snowballing effect and tends to enter into every part of the student-advisor interactions. From the student side, they see every difficulty and problem with the research as something that they give to the advisor to solve. From the advisor’s side, the student appears to take the role of a child and appears incapable of doing anything for themselves. Once this negative spiral starts, it will not end well for either party. No matter how many times the student is told that they need to take ownership of their work, they never appear to understand and, speaking for myself, this has resulted in the worst student-advisor interactions I have experienced. For this reason, the number one responsibility must be for the student to: Take ownership of your PhD Once this has happened, everything else follows without much difficulty. Advisor responsibilities are: To give advice and feedback in a timely manner Provide the resources needed to complete the project (or at least guide towards resource provision in the case where students are raising their project funding) See that all necessary administrative details are carried out. Nobody likes this aspect, and this does not mean that the advisor does all of this work - they may ask the student to help, or there may be an administrative assistant. In many institutions, timing is very important and forms must be completed and submitted by certain dates otherwise penalties may well be incurred. It is better if the student is also aware of these dates so that they can place them in their calendar. Not to burden the student with duties that are beyond their role. This can be complicated if the student is employed by the advisor (e.g., as a demonstrator or as a research assistant on a project), but I hear of nightmares where advisors effectively have students take over the running of their laboratories and the other personnel within them. Either party should be able to ask for help with things that are outside the purview of the project, but there are real examples of abuses that I find distressing. Help build a network for their students. Networks are extremely important for students when they move on from their PhDs, and even within this time see Measey (2022). The more your advisor understands your plan, the more likely they are to help you build an appropriate network. Professional development is very similar to building a network, but this may include training in particular skills. As above, your advisor can only do this if they understand your plan and what your future needs will be. Additional student responsibilities: Be sufficiently well-organised and manage their own time (in meetings and other areas) Communicate effectively Be pro-active with time-management, finding solutions, and Carry out their project to their satisfaction. The most important point will always be for you to: Take ownership of your PhD 8.5.1 Time management Time management is perhaps one of the most important skills that you will learn during the course of your PhD (see Part I). For much of your PhD period, your time will be your own to do with as you see fit. But in order to complete your PhD project on time, you will need to work in an efficient manner. There is a separate chapter on time management and a lot of advice on the internet, but the most important point will be to find a style that works for you. Different people will swear by what works for them, but time management is an individual relevant skill that is not necessarily transferable. Find what works for you best as soon as possible, and then plan the total duration of your PhD studies and day-to-day calendar accordingly. With respect to your advisor, remember that they will also be managing their time and that they are likely to have a lot of additional commitments. They also only have a certain number of hours in the week to fulfil all of these commitments. This means that you will need to be flexible in accommodating them and fitting into their times. Then, when you do meet with them, you need to make sure that you make the most of the time available. 8.6 Respect and Professionalism Your relationship with your advisor is a professional one. They are a professional, and they have many more duties than advising you and you should respect this. At the same time, they have a professional duty to your supervision. I suggest that you maintain a professional relationship with them whenever possible. This relationship should be built on the respect that you have for one another. The more that you display a professional relationship with your advisor, the more likely it is that they will treat you back with mutual respect and professionalism. Both advisor and student should share the same goals which adhere to the four tenets of the scientific method: rigour, independence, transparency and reproducibility. 8.6.1 Take advice The key responsibility of your advisor is to advise you. They are in that role because they have experience, and they will bring this experience into play when they give you advice. If you are given advice, please consider it. Don’t simply reject the advice immediately after it is given. If you think carefully about the advice and decide to act against it, bring this up as a discussion point in a meeting and be ready to defend your decision. There are plenty of times when you are safe to not take advice that you are given by your advisor, but you should always carefully consider it. This is most common towards the end of your studies when you know far more about the project than your advisor does. When your advisor cannot accept a disagreement on their advice, this can lead to serious problems (see Gunnarsson, Jonasson &amp; Billhult, 2013) and you may need to go back to your student-advisor agreement. Most advisors should be sufficiently wise to allow you to not follow their advice. But there will be some occasions when you cannot go against the advice. For example, if the funds for your project have been raised by your advisor and they are responsible to the funder, then you do not have the freedom to decide how they will be spent. Similarly, if deadlines are in play for your advisor then you need to respect their professional responsibilities to others. In general, your student-advisor relationship exists because your advisor is there to give you advice on how to achieve your project goals. If you never have any intention of following any of the advice that they give you, then you misunderstood the relationship. 8.6.2 Personal problems Everyone has their own personal problems, but it is not fair to bring all of them to the workplace unless they are likely to impact your work. I have started with this as a statement as students often find it hard to decide what personal problems they need to bring to their advisor. Simply ask yourself, is this problem likely to affect my work? If the answer is yes, then inform your advisor. When you inform them, be aware that it is your problem (and not theirs), and make sure to point out to them as precisely as you can how you think it will affect your work. Advisors are also human, and they are likely to understand. But you shouldn’t be hoping for more than understanding. You can’t look to your advisor to help solve your personal problem. Of course, this goes both ways. Advisors are people too. They make mistakes. They have limited hours in the day. They have lives outside of academia that can influence their lives inside (feeling sick, family issues, holidays, etc.). There will be days when your advisor might be in a bad mood; maybe it’s a day when they didn’t get the research funding they had applied for. There will be many external frustrations for them, and this is unlikely to be a reflection on you. Be kind and considerate. It is worth taking time to share their down times, if they are willing to, at the very least so that you can understand them a little better. There will be times when the home life of your advisor may impinge on their responsibilities to you. When they tell you, they are looking for your understanding. Be kind to your advisor as you would want them to be kind to you. 8.7 When things do go wrong There are many possible courses of action open to you, but my best advice is to know what these are before anything bad happens. Just like protecting your mental-health, you can be proactive to know what your options are in the case of your student-advisor relationship going bad. The best is to have a signed student-advisor agreement. In addition, you can find out what provision your institution has made in such eventualities. If they have no formal schema (which seems unlikely these days), then you can try to have one instigated by taking a template from another institution. Advice for when things go wrong with your advisor is very similar to that of academic bullying (Malaga-Trillo &amp; Gerlach, 2004; Mahmoudi, 2020; Mahmoudi &amp; Keashly, 2021; Measey, 2022): Increase your level of professionalism. Ask for your institutional rules. Document your case. Share your burden with a trusted friend or colleague. Follow your university’s rules with your complaint. I want to emphasise point 1 on the above list. While you may not be the cause of this problem, the best way of tackling it will be to become extra-professional. This means becoming meticulous about documenting your interactions, and maintaining a high level of professionalism as you do so. The more you increase your level of professionalism, the less likely your badly behaved advisor will be able to get away with abusing their power. 8.8 Having more than one advisor This happens with increasing frequency, and disputes between advisors can leave the students in the middle with serious problems (see Gunnarsson, Jonasson &amp; Billhult, 2013). I have experienced these kinds of issues with students who are co-supervised by another academic. When the academics disagree about the way forward, I tell the student that they have had advice from both advisors and that it is now up to the student to decide which advice (if either) to follow. I don’t see this as a problem. But not all academics are the same! In the case that you do find yourself in a position with two advisors then I suggest that you make sure that you have an agreement with both of them that includes what to do in these situations. 8.9 Celebrations I hope that there will be lots of reasons for you to celebrate with your advisor and the rest of your team. Celebrating achievements is a really important part of working together, even if the achievement is simply that you have survived another year. If there is no existing tradition of celebrating in your lab, then it’s time for you to start one. 8.9.1 Share the down times While I hope that there will be lots of reasons for you to celebrate, we should not pretend that there will not be down times when things don’t work and people get frustrated, upset and disappointed. It is important to share these times too so that people understand why you might not be at your best on any particular day. Don’t keep it to yourself. If you and your advisor can be kind to each other, and take the time to commiserate the down times as well as share the successes, then you will likely have a good productive relationship.

"],["critical.html", "Chapter 9 Why critical reading is crucial for improving your writing 9.1 Making notes on good and bad styles 9.2 Some examples 9.3 Make handwritten notes 9.4 Recognising good or bad in what you read", " Chapter 9 Why critical reading is crucial for improving your writing It is hard to emphasise exactly how important your reading will be, when it comes to your writing. If you are sitting with a blank page in front of you and feel that you have nothing to draw on, then think again. All of the reading that you have done to get to this point has already helped you more than you think. As I’ve pointed out elsewhere, your chapter or manuscript is likely to resemble the formula that many others already follow, and standing on the shoulders of those giants will help you again. But it’s possible that your reading isn’t helpful if you aren’t being sufficiently ‘critical’ when you read: and by critical, I am talking about the methodical approach that you take to reading that improves your comprehension of a paper (Figure 9.1). FIGURE 9.1: Critical reading is seen as being made up of five important aspects. This diagram shows how each of the five aspects feeds into the next. 9.1 Making notes on good and bad styles When you read, it’s worth making all sorts of comments about what you’re reading. It’s tempting to think that the only aspects of a paper that you should take notes on are the science (questions, approach and findings), but this is only part of your mandate as a critical reader. Of course, you should be taking notes on the science, but you should also be using it as an opportunity to learn tips and tricks of writing. Once you are actively writing, and I’d suggest that this should have been right from the very beginning of your studies, you should be actively thinking about how the authors are writing. Are they writing well? Are parts written poorly? Then the critical part is to cogitate, albeit briefly: what works, what doesn’t and why. Some papers will only offer the science that they contain. Others will stand out because you’ll realise that you enjoy reading them. As a critical reader, your task is to decide why you enjoy reading a paper: Is it the style? Is it the way in which they formulate the logic of their argument? Could it be that they’ve broken the standard formula? Is it just the title, or the first sentence that you enjoy? Once you’ve decided what it is, make these notes on the paper and file them on your referencing system (however you do it) under a style heading. I’d suggest that this be completely separate from your notes on the science. This is as simple as highlighting or making a quick note each time you see something that you like, or dislike (use different colours consistently). I used to underline text in pencil, and then make an illegible comment in the margin. It worked for me, not because I could read the comment, but because I could remember writing the comment. You can also learn from badly written papers. Again, ask yourself exactly what it is about the writing style that doesn’t work for you? If you don’t know then comment in your database and make a group of papers that don’t read well. Do they have anything in common? It won’t be every paper you read that you make notes about the style. It will probably only be a minority of papers in your area. However, this critical reading where you make notes on the ones that do stand out will help you greatly when it comes to your own writing. 9.2 Some examples Instead of using a taxonomic list (I don’t like lists) and long citation string to describe lots of different studies that had previously made the same point, a co-author (in a recent review study) organised them all into the same categories we were presenting in a review. The result was that the reader was reminded of our categories at the same time as seeing how well others had already covered these same topics. Being able to sum up a paragraph with a clincher sentence that also has a segway into the next paragraphs is a great skill to have Some authors are able to generate a theme that they develop over several paragraphs or pages If you’ve spotted what it is that you like, write it down and commit it to memory. The very fact that you start to see things in other people’s writing that you like and admire means that you’ve managed to start reading critically. Keep this up, and it will help your writing no end as you open up your mind to critical reading. You don’t have to restrict yourself in what you can learn while reading other people’s papers. Think about the stages in writing a paragraph. Look at the paragraphs you are reading and see if you can spot the subject and summary sentences. Maybe they are absent from the entire paper, or maybe they are present in every paragraph. Does it help enhance the readability of the paper? What about the times when authors break the rules? Can you see in your reading that the majority of authors the follow rules? Do they follow the formula? What is the power in shaking it all up? If it works, try and analyse why it works. Then you will be reading critically. 9.3 Make handwritten notes When I started reading papers, I made photocopies (1 sided was as sophisticated as it got) from volumes of bound journal issues, and made notes in pencil on the back and front of those pages as I read. I understand that most of you will be working on pdfs which offer possibilities to add notes in text boxes that go alongside. But there still may be more advantages to writing notes using your own handwriting. A study by Mueller and Oppenheimer (2014) showed that students who typed retained less of the content from a lecture than those that made notes by hand. They showed that this was because those who used a keyboard tended to take notes that were more shallow, while those that wrote their notes had a deeper thinking. My take on this is that the brain is making extra connections when you are taking notes by hand. Those extra connections will benefit you when it comes to trying to recall the study. Another advantage that making notes by hand brings you is that you can deliberately associate the location in which you read, and practice your handwritten notes, with the place where you want to eventually write and recall what you’ve learned (see Bouton, 1993). Thus you can manipulate this facet of human memory to do all your learning, for example, at your desk in the department, or in the university library. Eccentrics may want to link it to reading in the bath, or another place of great comfort. But be careful not to make your ‘place’ too specific. You could move house or have someone else allocated to your desk, and that wouldn’t work out well. However you decide to make your notes, make sure that it works for you both in the present, and for the later stages of your PhD studies. Similarly, if you make notes on style, you are likely to remember them in the same way that you remember the paper and its contents. An alternative to writing everything onto a printed copy is to make notes in a notebook. That way you get the advantage of building your memory with your own writing, and you can easily find everything in the same place when you forget where you read the fascinating insight. Alternatively, you may want to print the most important papers in your area, and make notes in pencil all over them. It’s important to emphasise that you should not copy and paste parts of someone’s paper that you like. It’s easy to do, but any copying could be your undoing if you later forget and paste your ‘notes’ into your manuscript. It’s so easy to plagiarise like this that the only way to really avoid it is by being very strict with yourself. Making notes by hand will force you to look away from the written text while you write, and you’ll be unlikely to inadvertently copy anything. The advantages of writing notes by hand then make it greatly advantageous to restricting yourself to your computer (tablet or cell!). 9.4 Recognising good or bad in what you read It’s going to be hard to read and think at the same time. A little like walking and chewing gum, it comes with experience. And if you do fall over, stop chewing for a while and wait until you’ve got into your stride before having another go. Thinking is all part of the reading process, and while I agree that it might be hard to think on multiple levels while you read, it is possible. For example, consider what other worthy things you’ve thought about while reading this book. If you’ve not stopped to check your phone, or think about eating or drinking something, well done. It might be worth creating an atmosphere with less extraneous stimulants while you read. If you only have your reading material and notebook, you’ll be able to concentrate all of your thinking on them instead of getting distracted. If you can’t decide what it is that you enjoy from one paper, take it further. Take a look at the first author (likely to be the person responsible for the writing style). Have they written other papers, and do these have those same qualities? Or maybe it’s the lab that they came from. Try to find the lab’s pages on the internet and see if there are other inspiring papers there. There is also a possibility that you are struggling to get insight with your reading because English isn’t your first language. The subtleties of some of the usage of English may be passing you by. Because of the large number of words, it is possible to write something in English in many different ways. The overall aim is to convey the largest amount of information possible in the smallest number of words, while enhancing the context, meaning and readability. It’s not easy, but the only way you’ll ever get good is by starting, and reading and writing as much as possible. If you are still struggling, a really good way forward is to start a journal club with your colleagues. It is probable that you aren’t the only one who is having difficulties. There may already be a journal club in your institution which may (or may not) be a good place to go. What you do need is a safe space in which you aren’t afraid to say when you don’t understand. Think of it as a book club for scientific papers. After all, it may be that no-one understands and the paper is badly written. Alternatively, it can be that someone is able to help you quickly and easily. They can then give you extra insights into how and why they think the author is crafting their paper. This will then help you with your reading as well as your writing. If you are looking for good fodder for your journal club, consider reviewing a preprint and publishing your review with a DOI (Teixeira da Silva, Al-Khatib &amp; Dobranszki, 2017). This will make the whole exercise a lot more worthwhile and produce a net output for your club. References Bouton ME. 1993.

"],["regularwriting.html", "Chapter 10 Regular writing 10.1 Write every day 10.2 Aims and outlines 10.3 Polishing your text 10.4 Be disciplined", " Chapter 10 Regular writing This book is about writing your PhD in Biological Sciences. This chapter is about using regular writing as a core skill to improve your writing skills throughout the duration of your PhD studies. Writing is a core skill that you need to work on, and a regular writing slot is the best way to develop this skill. This chapter will be short because, unlike the other core skills in this section of the book, the rest of the book will go into scientific writing in detail and provide you with all the advice you need to get started writing. Just like any skill, you can’t expect that scientific writing is going to come easily to you, and you need to invest time not only to learn how to do it (Parts II and III), but also to practice writing so that you implement the skills that you learn on a daily basis. Regular writing and implementing what you learn in this book will be the best way to improve your scientific writing skills. 10.1 Write every day When you make your day-to-day calendar for your normal working week, I strongly suggest that you put a 40 minute block every day that you dedicate to scientific writing (i.e. thesis writing). Know what topic you are going to write about before you start, and make sure that you have already conducted the relevant critical reading to accomplish this. Start your 40 minute block by writing the outline of your work with a list of relevant papers to cite. Then concentrate for these 40 minutes on writing something that meets the goal you set. You need to be realistic about what you can achieve in 40 minutes. Especially at the start of your PhD, you might not be able to write more than a few sentences or a paragraph in 40 minutes. At the very beginning you might even struggle to complete your outline. However, the discipline of dedicating 40 minutes every day to undistracted writing will pay-off over time. Don’t expect perfection in these 40 minute sessions. Instead, concentrate on your plan and think about how to introduce (topic sentence), and logically link sentences that are backed up with citations. The first paragraph that you write may not be a keeper, but making that start is important as it will show you what you need to change. Build on your paragraph, but don’t return to the same paragraph every day. It is important to change the writing topic often enough so that you don’t get stuck on a particularly difficult task. By changing the topic several times during your week, you’ll should find that it retains your interest. You can add plan in weeks to come to return to tasks that you are struggling with or which need more time to complete. While I recommend that you write every day, I would stress that this means every working day. You should have a break for at least one day a week. You should also have some days every year when you have a holiday and others where you are doing other tasks, like fieldwork, that will preclude you from writing every day. 10.1.1 Remember your critical reading Daily writing will go hand-in-hand with daily critical reading. Plan both of these activities in a complimentary way so that you have the reading foundation for what you plan to write. However, make sure that you mix it up so that you get some variety in what you are reading. 10.1.2 Reflection Once you start writing regularly, you will find that you have ideas about how to solve writing problems and ideas about what to cite at other times during your day. Keep a ‘writing notes’ file or a page in your notebook where you can jot down these ideas, and come back to them in your regular writing time-slot. As stressed in the chapter on health, time spent thinking and reflecting on many aspects of your PhD is very important. During your sleeping hours your brain will make connections between items and tasks that you have conducted during the day. Hence, it may be that it may be a only day or two later that connections become clear to you. These insights can be very valuable, so make sure that you keep a note of them and look into them further to see whether they are worthy or important. Remember that your brain can also make false connections, so not every idea will be a winner. 10.1.3 Use one of the best time-slots When planning your regular writing, use one of the time slots when you know that your concentration will be at its best. Don’t use a time when you know that you are likely to be tired or unfocussed. The idea here is to maximise your ability to write, during these time-slots. In time, you may well find that as your writing becomes better you will need to dedicate the best time-slots to other priority tasks. But when you start, I’d advise you to begin by keeping the best time-slots for daily writing tasks and critical reading. 10.1.4 The space in which you write You will see a lot of advice online about the writing environment. Essentially, this comes down to how the psyche works linking certain spaces with work and others with not working. For example, using the same space to try to work as you do for checking social media or playing games will build an association other than work with that space. This is not beneficial to working. So if you can, separate the places where you do your regular writing from those where you reward yourself. 10.1.5 When you haven’t read enough At first you will not have read enough papers to properly plan or cite all the relevant literature for the paragraph that you aim. In these first few weeks, concentrate on some of the writing techniques that you are reading about (in this book and elsewhere) so that you get some practical experience of writing some logical sentences, writing hypotheses, etc. The point of making this daily practice in writing is to get yourself used to writing in a scientific way. You can start this from day one, only having read a few of the chapters from this book, so give it a go. 10.1.6 Don’t allow yourself to get stuck The aim of this time is to actually write. What you don’t want to do is spend any time staring at a blank screen or constantly tweak a single sentence or phrase because you can’t get it to sound the way you want it. Remember that writing well takes practice, and that this session is focussing on the practice. You won’t get the sentence perfect the first time that you write it and so you should expect that what you write during this sessions is going to need more work. If you feel like you are getting stuck with your writing during a writing session, then highlight that sentence in a consistent colour for writing that needs work (e.g., red), and move on. Start writing a different sentence or paragraph. In your next regular writing session you will be able to go back to these difficult phrases where you got stuck and give them another go. You may find that you immediately solve the problem (thinking time and good sleep do wonders for getting stuck). Or you may find that the problem is still intractable. If after a week of returning to the phrase/sentence/paragraph you are still stuck make sure that you put this aside and concentrate on another topic for the next week and don’t return to this one for a week or longer. Start again with the same outline of what you want to write and build it up without any reference to what you wrote before. There is also an influence of your mental attitude towards writing. Never start a session thinking that you are going to get stuck, or that you can’t write. You can write. It takes practice and the practice takes time and that is the purpose of these time slots. If you find yourself getting into a negative frame of mind before you start your session, try repeating a positive writing mantra before you start. I can write. I will write. Regular writing practice is what I need to improve my writing. If you remain stuck after returning to it, then discuss it with people around you. You could also get inspiration from Artificial Intellegence (but don’t copy it) There’s always a way to solve issues when you get stuck, but some are definitely more tricky than others. Time (while you think about it) and input from others are usually sufficient to solve the trickiest of writing problems that get you stuck. 10.2 Aims and outlines The aim of your writing session and an outline is a very important part of the writing process (Figure 10.1). You must make sure that you know what information you are trying to convey to the reader before you start. It’s best if you can write this aim down. This is important as once you have written your piece, you will need to polish and check it and then make sure that it meets your intended aim. If you don’t write down what you are trying to tell the reader, then it’s really hard to check that you have met your aim once you’re done. Writing easily becomes aimless, especially when you are building arguments and trying to include all of the citations that you need. Your topic sentence should keep you true, but an aim and detailed outline are even better for making sure that you’ve done what you planned. FIGURE 10.1: Polishing and checking your text. The writing process includes a planning phase including the aims and outlining before the actual writing itself. Once you have written text you will need to polish it (perhaps many times) and then check that it meets your original aims. 10.3 Polishing your text Once you get into the flow of writing, you should maximise this time within your 40 minute block. But if you have time, or in the next block, you also need to read through what you have written. I find that I need time between writing and reading. It could be a different time in the same day, or even the next day. I need the time because if I immediately read what I have just written, I can correct some spelling an minor grammatical errors, but I still feel too close to the composition of the writing to know whether it has the intended flow, and importantly, whether it meets the objective of what I’m trying to convey to the reader. If you have any difficulty reading your own text, then a lot of word processing software will now read it to you, so this is a very useful feature as you may be able to spot difficulties when you hear what you have written being read aloud. Thus, reading what you’ve written will be an important part of each of your writing sessions. But it may be that you are reading what you wrote days or weeks before. I think of this process as polishing (Figure 10.1). Once I am reasonably happy with a section of writing, I know that it will need two or three polishing sessions before I think of it as finished - or at least good enough to share with co-authors, or in your case to show your advisor. It may be that when you start, you need more than two polishing sessions. That’s ok. Give yourself as much time as you need to get it to a point where you feel comfortable sharing it (with the caveat that you also need to know you have sufficient confidence). 10.4 Be disciplined Make sure that the 40 minutes you have allocated to writing are spent doing writing tasks. If you fill your 40 minutes with reading, arranging your chair, screen, table then you won’t be helping yourself. Especially if you reinforce this by rewarding yourself it will actually cement these displacement activities instead of rewarding being productive. It will be up to you to decide whether or not you have achieved your goals.

I consider the scientific project as a path that humanity should continue to travel to reach a higher and more just way of living. Our societies have evolved from places where superstition and belief were the basis for societal rules that favoured the privileged classes. Science is a process in which we reach conclusions based on egalitarian reasoning and evidence, something that we can aspire for in the larger community around us. Already, most societies are making the majority of their collective evidence-based decisions through the guidance of science. Therefore, if we consider our knowledge-based societies to be democratic, then all citizens of that society should understand the processes under which the foundation of that knowledge is acquired (Sagan, 2011). Yet globally, public skepticism in science has been rising and has reached as high as 35% (see here). To consolidate this growing position of science in society, and the decline in public acceptance, scientists will need to become more open, communicative and seen to be conducting their profession in a way that reflects these ideals. There is evidence that increasing communication from scientists to the public results in a decrease in scepticism (Goldenberg, 2023). Imagine a world in which all of the principal decisions are made as a result of advances in science, but vanishingly small numbers of people actually understand how science works. This is not a world that we would want, but as Carl Sagan (Sagan, 2011) pointed out, it’s one that could all too easily happen. Therefore, to prevent the workings of science falling into the hands of a minority, we have a duty to communicate our science to the majority. Ultimately, what we want from the scientific project is to draw everyone in. That is not to say that there is no place in the world for other subject areas. One of the greatest misadventures in my own education was the indoctrination that I received that there were two streams in education, one for STEM and one for arts. I hope that you managed to escape this narrow minded and factually incorrect view, because as you will discover there are high levels of creativity demanded within the scientific framework, and those who have more talent in communicating their science will likely be more successful in their careers as a result. Moving forward with the scientific project does not mean that everyone must become a scientist, but instead that the process by which scientists establish knowledge is understood. Indeed, as we shall see (below), sceptical thinking, as exemplified in science, is a healthy way for everyone in society to avoid time wasting and potentially being deceived or conned. It is also vital that the scientific process be transparent in a way that results can be understood and therefore respected. Here I provide an example of the way in which there is a need for efficient communication between biological sciences and civic society: 11.1 Example: Invasive species Alien species are those that have been moved by human agents across biogeographic barriers into parts of the world where they did not evolve. Once these aliens arrive in their new environment, some reproduce and become established, and after a lag, a fraction of these spread, and become invasive, often with substantial impacts on the environment and the socio-economic efforts of people in those invaded areas. Invasive species disproportionately affect poorer people in our society, often completely disassociated with the pathways responsible for the introduction and spread. Removing invasive species requires a considerable amount of effort, and unless this is supplied by taxpayers, via governmental policy, falls on those directly impacted. Invasion science, the expanded transdisciplinary area stemming from invasion biology, is required to engage with all stakeholders in invasions, and most importantly to prevent new invasions. Because introductions are made by humans there is a critical need to communicate with those stakeholders along introduction pathways. For existing invasions, social scientists and economists are needed to determine their impacts on people in invaded areas and determine how to best alleviate the invasion or mitigate its effects without it moving further and impacting more communities. Biological scientists need to assess the impact on the environment, and investigate ways in which the species can be removed, their spread curtailed, or their impacts neutralised. Importantly, the results need to be discussed with all stakeholders to achieve a desirable outcome for those impacted most. Invasions at larger scales will normally require governmental resources to ensure that communities can continue to function, especially to best deliver their services to the society. Governments require evidence-based decisions that are reached from well-researched studies conducted in the field. Effective measures may necessitate large sums of money, and governments require that this process be transparent so that the taxpayers’ money they are investing is spent efficiently. We know enough about invasive species to be aware that there are greater threats to society from species that have not yet arrived than those already present. This means that all societies need to guard against the threat of potential future invasions, and still maintain the trade that brings needed goods into their areas. Most societies have no checks in place, but the immediate need to prevent new invasions, and halt the effects of existing ones, is recognised on a global scale. Biologists have an important role to play as key agents in informing society on the impacts (especially when they disproportionately impact those least privileged in society), pathways, removal and prevention of invasive species. Failure to effectively communicate with any of the stakeholders along the invasion pathway will result in more propagules arriving, and with them the increased chance of more species becoming established and eventually invasive. In the case of biological invasions, communication needs first to flow from the various stakeholders to direct the research needed. The solutions required are context specific, and the lessons learned need to be communicated back to the stakeholders, including governmental policy makers, in the form they require to action the findings. Ineffective communication from scientists to the stakeholders may result in solutions being ignored or misinterpreted. Documentation disseminated to the global scientific community, through scientific publications, is needed in case it may help the response of other societies with similar problems. 11.2 Should society lead the sciences or sciences lead society? Of course, the answer is simply that there must be feedback between science and society. As science advances, society learns of these advances and views are advanced. To become incorporated as a societal norm takes time. Over time, views from science that appear radical to society become mainstream and accepted. Think of the views on the earth being round, or more recently, the general acceptance that the universe started with the ‘big bang’. The counterculture faction in society, also known as post-truth, that espouses views accepted by the mainstream and proved by science beyond a reasonable doubt is not a novel phenomenon. Indeed, in the scientific project, we need to accept that these views will persist and empower the general populace to understand why and how they can be shown to be false. Hence, your view that the earth is not flat is bolstered if you can provide three ways to demonstrate this as fact (pick the ones you like from 7 listed here or here). Otherwise, your assertion that it is not flat will appear as easily denied as a ‘flat-earther’s’ assertion that it is. Thus the power of the scientific argument in society is that it is not simply contradiction or gainsay but that there is evidence. The scientific project is currently not the open virtuous eutopia that we would like. Indeed, as scientists are humans and part of the current society, they are prone to the same trappings of wielding power and influence to get ahead. As you get toward the end of this book, you will see me calling out increasing parts of the scientific project that are currently riddled with bias, thereby weakening the entire process and disenfranchising the most vulnerable. Reforming science is no easy task. Reforms are needed throughout the structures that fund, employ and disseminate scientific research. Sweeping this all away will take a concerted effort but might well be easier in science than in other sectors of society. Nearly all scientists recognise that science needs to be objective and impartial in order to succeed. Their objectivity makes them an ideal group to kickstart a fairer, more transparent and open system. As you will see, there has already been a move to make science more open, and by embracing this transparency the next generation of scientists will reap the benefits, and be on a sounder footing to improve a better scientific society. 11.3 Carl Sagan’s “Baloney detection kit” or “How to know when what you smell is bullshit” In his book, Demon-Haunted World, Carl Sagan (2011) provides his take on how science provides scientists with what he terms ‘Baloney Detection’, commonly referred to today as ‘bullshit’. These are well worth recording here as they provide a guiding light for all scientists whether they be novices, emerging or established. They are also easily taught and the foundation of what we should spread in the Scientific Project. As humans, we are all susceptible to bullshit, hoaxes, charlatans and contrived deceptions as they are often more appealing than the truth. However, science is about truth-seeking, and by applying a set of simple rules, Sagan argues, we can avoid being misled or distracted by ideas that may waste our time and energy by using ‘skeptical thinking’. These rules are useful in your scientific life when considering hypotheses or when building arguments to explain your results. However, as Sagan argues, these simple rules are also useful in your day to day life, and as a simplified example of the scientific method, we can pass them onto all our fellow citizens. You should always seek independent confirmation of results. Seek out different opinions on the results and consider all possibilities. Don’t believe facts simply because they are spoken by an authority on the subject. We know that humans are prone to confirmation bias, and often exhibit motivated reasoning, especially if they have some vested interest. Even the most experienced have made mistakes in the past and will again in the future. My preferred way of thinking of this rule is to acknowledge that experts are made of ex- (a has been) and -spurt (a drip under pressure). Use a hypothetical deductive framework. Instead of accepting the first (hypothesis) explanation, think of all the possible reasons why a result might have occurred and then consider how you could (or perhaps you already have in your experiment) disproved each one. You may find that an untested hypothesis to explain the results represents a major caveat that could be tested, or can’t yet be tested. Either way, you need to remain open to the possibility that this explains your results. This leads neatly onto: Don’t get too involved with keeping your chosen hypothesis opening you to potential cofirmation bias. Remain critical to the possibility that it might be wrong, and provide ideas on how to substantiate or disprove competing hypotheses. If you don’t, others will. If at all possible, use a quantitative method to test your hypothesis. You should already be well on the way to this one inside your PhD, but it is worth bearing in mind especially when it comes to considering testing other competing hypotheses. How could they be quantitatively tested? Arguments (as we see later) consist of a chain of statements that follow one from the other. This chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and the strength of each link in the chain (your argumentative statements) must be critically considered by you. Occam’s Razor dictates that given two hypotheses that equally explain the results, the simpler one is likely more plausible. Or put another way, the more links you have in your chain, the more likely that one of them is not as strong as you would like it to be. Your hypothesis (or argument) must always be falsifiable. That is, that your test should be able to find that it is incorrect. If your test cannot show that your hypothesis is incorrect, then it isn’t worth much. Sagan provides plenty of real-world examples of each of these arguments, and I’d suggest that you consult his book (Sagan, 2011) if you are interested in following these up. Similar approaches, but written in different styles, are provided by Richard Dawkins in his (2004) book: A Devil’s Chaplain, and Julia Galef in her (2021) book: The Scout Mindset. 11.4 Live your life scientific “Science is more than a body of knowledge, it is a way of thinking” Carl Sagan (2011) I would encourage you not to stop your objective and evidence-based thinking when you leave the office or laboratory. By applying the rules of science to other sectors of society, you will find that there are many societal norms that could benefit from similar reform. Certainly, a lot of the technology developed through scientific inquiry can be used to help society reform, but scientific thinking will help everyone. As well as bringing the world to scientific thinking, as scientists we should take scientific thinking to the world. 11.5 Citizen science For a long time, I struggled with the term ‘citizen science’ as I reasoned that many such ventures did not involve citizens doing science. To me, most seemed focussed on outsourcing large tasks to willing public participants: i.e. having citizens do some grunt work. Collecting data or doing a fraction of the analysis is not science. However, in light of the scientific project, I have changed my mind. All of these projects offer citizens a way to participate in scientific projects in a way that was previously unavailable to them. They promote direct communication between scientists and citizens. In this way, they serve to promote the understanding of science to the general public. One aspect of this will be to bring more of the population into conducting scientific studies. This can be at the level of funding scientific studies. Crowdsourced scientific studies promote communication between the scientists and the funders to a level that is meaningful to both groups, such that they make up a large scale collaborative research interaction (Uhlmann et al., 2019). Citizen science contributions mean that the collection of data can be shared on a much broader scale, than would be traditionally possible. Of particular interest in the biological sciences is the identification and collection of locality data for biological species (on platforms such as iNaturalist). But increasing numbers of projects are demonstrating novel ways for the public to increasingly participate meaningfully in scientific endeavour (Silvertown, 2009; Bonney et al., 2014). Science is a joyful and spiritual experience for most of us that participate in it. There’s no reason not to spread that joy as widely as possible.

"],["part2.html", "Chapter 12 How to get started with writing", " Chapter 12 How to get started with writing Before you start writing The writing part of the PhD is often the most difficult for many students. I think that there are several reasons for this. Writing well comes with practice, and most PhD students have had little experience with academic writing even if they have already completed an MSc. The same could be said of most early-career scientists (even after their PhDs), because practice is measured in completed pieces, it usually takes many years rather than weeks or months. You shouldn’t expect that scientific writing will come automatically or immediately. In order to get this practice, you need to get started, and (again) many students find starting to write challenging. This guide was written to help you get started. However, before you start writing, it’s a good idea to understand some of the ways in which academic writing differs from other writing styles. Good planning is the key here, along with knowing exactly what it is that you’ll be writing about. That sounds facile, but at the foundation of each scientific study lies the hypothesis, which is central to being able to build the rest of the chapter. In this part of the book, I start with an explanation of the hypothesis. As you will see, the hypothesis is central to all of the writing in each chapter or paper, and you need to have a very good idea of how to formulate your research question into a hypothesis before you begin. Then I build on helping you think through lots of different aspects of writing in science: style, citations, writing concisely, scientific names, and lots more. Finally, I introduce you to the idea of using a formula to structure your writing. Before you start writing in earnest, it’d be good to read this part of the book and make sure that you are familiar with the ideas herein. Later, you may need to refer back to sections once you’ve started writing. "],["hypothesis.html", "Chapter 13 How to write a hypothesis", " Chapter 13 How to write a hypothesis When you read about the formula of writing a chapter (see end of part 2) you will see that everything in your chapter or paper revolves around the hypothesis or questions that you ask, normally at the end of your introduction (Figure 13.1). In this section, we will take a look at how to write a hypothesis. This is a sticking point for many students. We are used to using and writing questions and statements in day-to-day communications, as well as reading popular media. But hypotheses (the plural of hypothesis) only rarely float across our desks. So how do we write one, and how do we know if our hypothesis is good? In addition to this section, there is some good information out there on the web, and it’s worth looking at this too: (e.g. Wikihow, Wikipedia, etc.). There’s also some less good stuff out there, so read critically. FIGURE 13.1: Generating a good hypothesis for your PhD chapter isn’t easy. A good hypothesis will be invaluable in helping you write the chapter. It is important to start working with hypotheses. 13.0.1 What is a hypothesis? A hypothesis is a statement of your research intent. It tells the reader (because just like all of your other written work, it is intended for an audience who will read it), what you plan to do in your research. But there’s a little more to it than this. The hypothesis becomes a part of the scientific method if it is testable and (importantly) falsifiable, as well as being informed from previously published work on the subject. Your hypothesis must be informed by the literature, which is why you spent so much time and effort crafting your introduction to inform your reader of the same. This is also why your hypothesis usually comes at the end of your introduction, because you spend all of the introduction telling your reader about it. There’s not much point in writing more after the hypothesis, because once your reader has read that, they are ready to learn about how you went about testing it (in the Materials &amp; Methods). The other important point to make is that the literature should dictate how you write your hypothesis, and the variables that you include. If, for example, you know that temperature is the most important variable, but all of the literature suggests that it is oxygen, you can’t ignore oxygen and you should also frame your hypothesis using this variable (you can have more than one hypothesis after all!). In this case, you will also need to provide a sufficient introduction to temperature as a variable to justify its inclusion in your hypothesis. Perversely, your aim is not to prove that your idea is right, but to show that the hypothesis can be refuted. We try to write a hypothesis that is falsifiable: i.e. you can prove (usually using statistical tests) that it is not correct (or at least show that the likelihood that it is correct is very low). That’s why it is conventional to provide the ‘null hypothesis’ that is the falsified version of the statement, suggesting that there is no relationship between the variables you have proposed to measure. The convention is to label this ‘null hypothesis’ H0, while the ‘alternative hypothesis’ (the one that says your variables are related as you suggested) is written as H1. When you formulate your hypothesis, it is traditional to write your alternative hypothesis to indicate the directionality of your tested variables. This way, the reader can simply imply that the null hypothesis is when there is no relationship, but this will need to be stated if the null hypothesis is more complex. Karl Popper (2005) was the philosopher who proposed that without being able to refute or falsify a scientific problem, it ceases to be scientific. This is the reason for our null hypothesis. If the null is not available as a possible outcome, then logically, there is no science. Karl Popper (2005): “…it must be possible for an empirical scientific system to be refuted by experience”. It is worth noting here that rejecting the alternative hypothesis, or accepting the null hypothesis, does not mean that you have proved your null hypothesis (Altman &amp; Bland, 1995). Using the same logic described above, testing your hypothesis has two potential outcomes: showing that the hypothesised relationship is likely to exist (accepting H1), or rejecting this relationship (rejecting H1). The other way of thinking of this is the widely used adage: Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Most importantly, your hypothesis must come first, before you do the experiment or study. Hence the reason why this section comes at the start of part 2. Setting the hypothesis after the work is already done is fraudulent, and goes against the scientific method. Obviously, it isn’t fair to pose the hypothesis once you already know the answer (also known as HARKing). This is why there is so much emphasis put on formulating your hypothesis during your research proposal. Getting it right will determine what you do and how you test it. If you think of an extra hypothesis that would be really useful to test once you’ve already done your study, you can conduct a post hoc test, but this should have more stringent levels of statistical assessment. Writing a hypothesis isn’t easy, but it is essential, and once you’ve understood what to do most of the rest of what you are writing for should make sense. 13.0.2 What a hypothesis isn’t It is not a question and so should never have a question mark after it. It isn’t really a simple prediction: if this then that. You will see on the internet that hypotheses are explained in this simple predictive framework. I say that a hypothesis is not a simple prediction because it lacks the mechanistic and scholarly aspect of a good hypothesis, which is what we want to achieve. 13.0.3 A formulaic way to start writing your hypothesis: “If. then. because.” Later in the book, I will emphasise that you must have introduced all the variables that you plan to use to test your hypothesis in your introduction. This usually comes in the second paragraph of your introduction, where you emphasise the utility of the dependent variable/s (what you are planning to measure) and your independent variable (what you will manipulate). Both of these variables should then feature in your hypothesis. Next, by paragraph four, you will have identified the problem that you are interested in tackling. In addition, your introduction will provide all of the pertinent literature that has relevance to this hypothesis, giving the all important context. A simple way to consider making your hypothesis is to adopt an “If. then. because.” construction where you add in your problem statement using your independent variable after ‘if’, and your prediction using your dependent variable after ‘then’, and finally the expected mechanism after ‘because’. Using our example above with the “If. then. because.” construction, we would say: “If environmental temperatures in which tadpoles develop are increased then tadpole development rate is faster because they follow the classic metabolism of ectotherms”. Both independent variable (temperature) and dependent variable (tadpole development rate) are present in this hypothesis, and the predicted relationship between them is clear. In addition, the causal mechanism is stated. I say that this is a formulaic way to start writing your hypothesis, because it usually ends up as an inelegant statement, which can be better refined for a reader. A citation for your stated mechanism might also help clarify exactly where the justification for this comes from. Mechanisms (or causal explanations) fall into three main areas: endogenous, exogenous and evolutionary (Allen &amp; Baker, 2017). 13.0.3.1 Endogenous causal explanations Endogenous causal explanations focus on the mechanisms happening inside an organism, such as physiological processes, hormones, reproductive state, etc. 13.0.3.2 Exogenous causal explanations Exogenous causal explanations concern mechanisms that are outside the body of individuals. Common exogenous mechanisms are climatic factors (temperature, humidity, precipitation, etc.) or may relate to the availability of food, predators or mates. 13.0.3.3 Evolutionary causal explanations These mechanisms have evolved through time, and often relate to exogenous mechanisms triggering endogenous processes over multiple generations. Note then that the above mechanisms are not mutually exclusive in their nature, and it may be useful to combine different approaches within biology to ask hypotheses across all of these levels. Mechanisms in biological sciences are rarely simple or act on multiple organismal levels, so designing a controlled experiment in order to test a specific mechanism thoroughly can be very demanding. In other words, can you be sure that the cause is really responsible for the effect that you are measuring? A good hypothesis will often take an existing hypothesis further, to try to better refine the knowledge on a subject. Hence, it is perfectly acceptable to state that you are building on existing hypotheses (and giving the appropriate statement) when making your own. 13.0.4 Teleological versus causal hypotheses A teleological argument refers to the reason or a purpose of a particular process. For example, you may measure vertical migration of water fleas and suggest that diurnal migrations are made because the water fleas want to avoid predation. This is a teleological hypothesis because you are suggesting that the reason behind a process is the desire by water fleas to avoid predators. Although a reduction of predation may be a consequence of vertical migration in water fleas, each water flea does not think about predation and then starts it’s upward movement as a result. A common mistake made in biology is to apply teleological arguments to processes that have no purpose or reason. Evolution is often mistakenly suggested to have a purpose (e.g. to evolve to a more advanced state), but in fact, evolution is not a goal-orientated process. There is no end-point to evolution, and evolution did not start in order to meet some predetermined form or function. On the other hand, a causal hypothesis focuses on the factors about A that cause B. You should have realised that biologists are principally interested in causal hypotheses, because most mechanisms that are studied in biological sciences have no predetermined goal. If you are a behavioural ecologist, then you will need to be particularly aware of these two types of hypotheses, and when teleological explanations may be appropriate: many types of behaviour are goal orientated. 13.0.5 How to evaluate your hypothesis Once you’ve written your hypothesis, how do you decide whether or not it is good? To do this, you might think that you need plenty of experience (and yes, that does help). But really, you just need to look for the elements that are discussed above. So once you’ve written your hypothesis, try to objectively answer the questions below (for more see here): Is there a clear prediction (if. then. statement)? Does the prediction use independent and dependent variables correctly? Is the mechanism supported by the literature? Is the hypothesis testable/falsifiable? Does the hypothesis use concise wording and precise terminology? If your hypothesis meets all of the criteria above, then you’ve done a good job! Probably one of the hardest issues that you will face in biological sciences is to determine whether your dependent variable is reliant only on your independent variable of choice. For example, a lot of variance in biological sciences will relate to the climate (especially with global change studies), but if your independent variable is temperature, this means that you will need to keep all other climatic variables the same. That is, if temperature is your independent variable, it is the only variable that can change in your experiment. This type of experiment is challenging as temperature often affects other variables (especially that they may vary in an unpredictable way). As soon as you have more than one independent variables, you can no longer test your dependent variable because you don’t know which independent variable it is reacting to. Isolating variables is notoriously difficult, especially when we move from the laboratory to the field. You will need to think very carefully about what variables other than those of interest are potentially impacted by your experimental design. If you cannot control for them, this will likely mean that you need to change your hypothesis, or change your experimental design. If you are unsure, then I would encourage you to look carefully at the experiments that others have conducted in the literature. References Allen GE, Baker JJW. 2017.

In addition to accepting or rejecting your hypotheses, you also need to be familiar with Type I and Type II error rates, and the power of your tests. In this chapter, I concentrate on Type I and Type II errors, but there are other issues to consider when writing about your P values. Happily, others have written about the common misconceptions regarding P values (Goodman, 2008; Wasserstein &amp; Lazar, 2016). 14.1 Type I and Type II errors With all the will in the world, when you are testing your hypothesis using statistics, there is a chance that you will accept your alternative hypothesis when it is not valid. This is known as a ‘false positive’ or a Type I error (see Figure 14.1). It is also possible that you will reject your alternative hypothesis when you should have accepted it, also known as a Type II error, or a ‘false negative’. While it won’t be any fun to get a Type II error, as scientists, we should be more worried about Type I errors and the way in which they occur. This is because following a positive outcome, there is more chance that the work will be published, and that others may then pursue the same line of investigation mistakenly believing that their outcome is likely to be positive. Indeed, there are then lots of ways in which researchers may inadvertently or deliberately influence their outcomes towards Type I errors. This can even become a cultural bias that then permeates the literature. Humans have a bias towards getting positive results (Trivers, 2011). If you’ve put a lot of effort towards an experiment, then when you are interpreting your result you might feel motivated towards your reasoning making you more likely to accept your initial hypothesis. This is called ‘motivated reasoning’, and is a rational explanation why so many scientists get caught up in Type I errors. This is also known as a confirmation bias. Another manifestation of this is publication bias which also tends to be biased towards positive results, with as many as 84% of studies supporting their initial hypothesis (Fanelli, 2010). Thus scientists, being human, are more vulnerable to making Type I errors than Type II errors when evaluating their hypotheses. Although there are deliberate or inadvertent ways of making of Type I errors, here it is important to understand that simply by chance you can make a Type I error: accepting your alternative hypothesis even when it is not correct. To minimise this possibility to a reasonable level, most biologists set α (alpha) to 0.05 as an acceptable risk that they will encounter a false positive (Type I error). FIGURE 14.1: Type I and Type II errors. In this figure, the columns refer to the truth regarding a hypothesis, even though the truth is unknown to the researcher. The rows are what the researcher finds when testing their hypothesis. The blue squares are what we are hoping to achieve when we set and test our hypothesis. The grey squares may happen if the hypothesis we set is indeed false. The other two possibilities are the false positive Type I error (red), and the false negative Type II error (black). In the figure it seems that the chances of getting one of the four outcomes is equal, but in fact, this is far from reality. There are several factors that can change the size of each potential outcome to testing a hypothesis. In the following figures (Figures 14.2, 14.3 and 14.4), you see the outcome of 1000 hypotheses. You could think of these as outcomes of 1000 attempts at testing similar hypotheses in a global scientific effort by individual scientists. The power of the analysis is set at 40%, and α is set at 0.05. It is important to realise that α applies to all the tests that are made (whether or not the hypothesis is actually correct). This means that when α is set at 0.05, 5% of the time scientists will find that their hypothesis is correct whether or not this is actually true is, as we shall see, an interaction of several variables. FIGURE 14.2: The likelihood that highly unlikely hypotheses you test are accepted. This figure has been redrawn after figure 1 in Forstmeier et al. (2017). This is a graphical representation of an argument first made by Ioannidis (2005). 14.2 Changing the likelihood of a hypothesis The difference between Figure 14.2 and Figures 14.3 and 14.4 is the likelihood that the hypotheses are correct changes. In the first one (Figure 14.2) we see highly unlikely hypotheses that will only be correct one in a hundred times. The blue squares denote the proportion of times in which the hypotheses are tested and found to be true. The black squares denote false negative findings, i.e a Type II error. The red squares denote false positive findings, i.e. a Type I error. Because the hypothesis is highly unlikely to be correct the majority of squares are light grey denoting that it was correctly found to be untrue. Because α is set at 0.05, we can expect that 5% of the 990 incorrect hypotheses will give us a false positive (49 or 50 times). Although it might seem unlikely that anyone would test such highly unlikely hypotheses, there are increasing numbers of governments around the world that create incentives for researchers to investigate what they term ‘blue skies’ research, which might be better termed high-risk research or investigations into highly unlikely hypotheses. The real problem with such hypotheses is that you are more likely to get a Type I error than actually find that your hypothesis is truly correct. FIGURE 14.3: The likelihood that unlikely hypotheses you test are accepted. In this figure, we see a scenario of unlikely hypotheses that are found to be correct approximately one in 10 times. Now we see that the possibility of committing a Type I error is roughly equivalent to a Type II error and to the probability of finding that the hypothesis is truly correct. Thus, if your result comes out positive, you are unlikely to know why. FIGURE 14.4: The likelihood that likely hypotheses you test are accepted. In this figure, we see a scenario of likely hypotheses that are found to be correct approximately every other time. Now imagine some groundbreaking research (probably published in a high impact factor journal) that finds a highly unlikely (but presumably desirable) hypothesis is correct (our first scenario of 1 in 100). Researchers from other labs try to repeat the experiment, and some of them also find that they get positive results and get these published. None of the negative results get published, or the investigators don’t bother to submit them and move onto other areas of science. The positive results are written into text books and future generations of scientists test these types of hypotheses expecting them to be correct (our last scenario of 1 in 2). When the negative result is produced, a reasonable assumption is that a Type II error has been found, and that these scientists need to increase the power of their tests, inevitably increasing the cost of the experiment. But there are plenty of other ways that researchers could end up finding that their negative result is, in fact, positive, especially if this is what they are expecting. Simmons et al. (2011) refer to this as the ‘researcher degrees of freedom’ in which researchers inadvertently or deliberately end up getting positive results because of the way in which they treat either their hypothesis or analyse their data. It is easy to see how a false scientific culture can be erected in these mistaken beliefs, and it is important to be aware of this possibility. 14.3 Increasing the statistical power In all of these figures, the power of the analysis is set at 40%. The statistical power of any analysis depends on the sample size (or number of replicates) you’re able to use. Some research has suggested that in most ecological and evolutionary studies this is actually more like 20% (see references in Forstmeier, Wagenmakers &amp; Parker, 2017). What is important to notice in the next figure (Figure 14.5) is that when we change the power of the analysis (in this case from 40% to 20%) we influence the proportion of Type II errors over finding that the hypothesis is correct. While the overall numbers of Type I errors do not change, if your analysis tells you to accept your alternative hypothesis, there is now a 1 in 5 chance (20%) that it will be a false positive (Type I error). FIGURE 14.5: The likelihood that likely hypotheses you test are accepted when you increase the power. Here we see the scenario in which the hypotheses are quite likely to be correct one in two times. Now we can see that the possibility of creating a Type II error is highest. Next, the blue squares show us the chances that we find the hypothesis is truly correct. Lastly, there’s only 11% chance of a Type I error. What you should see when you look at these figures is that there is quite a high chance that we don’t correctly assign a true positive hypothesis. There’s actually much more chance that we will commit a Type II error. Worse, the more unlikely a hypothesis is, we are increasingly likely to commit the dreaded Type I error. From the outset, you should try to make sure that the hypotheses you are testing in your PhD are very likely to find positive results. In reality, this means that they are then iterations of hypotheses that are built on previous work. When you choose highly unlikely hypotheses, you need to be aware that this dramatically increases your chances of making a Type I error. The best way to overcome this is to look for multiple lines of evidence in your research. Once you have the most likely hypothesis that you can produce, you need to crank up your sampling so that you increase the power of your analysis, avoiding Type II errors. In biological sciences, we have more options than many scientific disciplines to investigate potentially false cultural beliefs by using different model species, and looking at problems through different mechanisms. Presenting complementary results from multiple lines of evidence within your thesis is an extremely powerful way to build evidence for your hypothesis. However, this requires the creativity of experimental design as well as an open mind. It may mean that you have to draw upon the most fundamental of scientific abilities: to be comfortable with being wrong. It may also require dogged determination in terms of publishing negative results against the currently prevailing culture. If your appetite is piqued by this subject, be sure to read the references cited, and read around this subject.

So far, we have concentrated on thesis chapters or manuscripts that have hypotheses to test. I have emphasised that there is a need to focus all of the sections of your writing to help frame and understand the hypothesis (in the Introduction), explain your approach in collecting and testing the variables (in the Materials and Methods), provide the results of your tests (in the Results), and respond to the hypothesis (in the Discussion) together with placing it in the context of other work. But what if you don’t have a hypothesis to test? There are lots of reasons why manuscripts don’t have hypotheses, and the chances are that in a PhD thesis (for example) you will have at least one chapter where there isn’t a hypothesis tested. It’s also possible that you won’t have any hypotheses tested, and this is the approach in some disciplines. So, given all the emphasis above, what can be done? 15.1 Is having a hypothesis the gold standard? The hypo-deductive method is certainly a powerful one to use in science but, no matter what you have read or been taught elsewhere, it is not the only scientific approach. Much of what we do in science comes from observational work, and these observations are usually the basis for many of the hypotheses that we pose. But some disciplines are entirely based on observations, and this does not make them obsolete or unscientific. Such disciplines simply don’t lend themselves to experimentation, and without an experiment it is hard to control and hypothesise. But we should not confine ourselves to an entirely experimental approach. Here are some reasons why using non-experimental approaches will benefit our science: Observational science (something that I refer to elsewhere as Natural History Observations) can teach us a lot more about systems and inspire greater creativity in our work than plodding from experiment to experiment. We can infer patterns from process. As humans, we are evolutionarily programmed to see patterns (even when they aren’t there) and recognise patterns in the world around us (e.g., Linhares &amp; Chada, 2013). It would be crazy to put this ability aside and ignore it when conducting science. Clearly, we are also able to make mistakes when we infer patterns from processes, but this does not mean that it should not be done. But we need to engage in a much more cautious manner when using this approach, always being aware of our bias towards certain explanations so that we encompass others. I would also argue here that this is instrumental in forming hypotheses to test experimentally or in models. Models of systems are powerful tools to test questions. Models are always simplified versions of complex biological systems, but their power as tools in our scientific approach should no longer be questioned. Indeed, there are many shortcomings to using a hypo-deductive approach, as we have seen in the previous chapter. By allowing ourselves a liberal approach to science methodology we are far more likely to make new connections and infer novel patterns about biological processes. We are more able to be inclusive of different disciplines. It is likely to be advantageous to be open to these diversity of approaches in others’ research, just as you should in your own approach. 15.2 Why am I always banging on about hypotheses? Throughout this book (and in other books) I constantly refer to hypotheses and how important they are when writing your thesis chapters. Why do I do this when I am clearly so positive about using other methods? In many respects, this comes from my attempt to simplify. In most cases, you could replace the word “hypothesis” with “central problematic” and get the same effect. You could also replace some instances with “aim” or “objective” (but not all). There are some points that are unique to hypotheses, and that’s why I made my choice about referring to these as they are, generally speaking, the most complex of these alternative approaches. I reason that if you can understand how to approach writing to respond to hypotheses, then you can turn this same approach to your own needs. Add to this that most people, scientists included, misunderstand hypotheses, so there is a need to discuss them and their uses more. If you are a biological scientist that does not use hypotheses, then this does not make you inferior, and I hope that you will still find this book useful. If this is you, then let me apologise here and suggest that you mentally shift whenever you read “hypothesis” to the alternative approach that you prefer. 15.3 Central problematic If you have a particular problem that your research is trying to solve, this may result in a new methodology or perspective rather than testing a hypothesis. This work is still suitable for a journal manuscript (and there are specific journals dedicated to new methodologies). Instead of introducing your hypothesis, you can simply introduce the problem that your methodology applies to. A new methodology will probably best fill an existing gap, and so your introduction will likely point out what this gap is, provide evidence for why existing methodologies don’t fill the gap, and outline the variables in your novel approach. Similarly, if you have a question but not a hypothesis, that your research tries to answer, you can take exactly the same approach to introduce your question. Hence, no matter what your central problem is, you still need to identify this and put it at the heart of your manuscript so that all of your sections address this point. Of course, there may be more than one, and if so, you will need to clearly articulate each one and explain how they are related to each other. If you are unsure about how to move forward, the best thing to do is to look to the literature for other examples of what you’re trying to do. Someone has very likely done something similar before. Don’t forget to chat about it with your advisor, as they may have ideas about where to look. 15.4 Does it matter that you don’t have a hypothesis? Proponents of the hypothetico-deductive method will argue that having a hypothesis makes your work stronger than if you only have a question or prediction. In each case, while your results might help answer your question or confirm your prediction, they won’t test the mechanism (so that you can’t explain why you have the results that you do), and they may not be falsifiable/refutable. Of course, Popper would argue that if you don’t have a null hypothesis, then your methodology isn’t scientific. 15.5 Avoid HARKing There is one very important aspect of your approach whether or not you have a hypothesis, and that is that you know exactly what your study aims are before you start. It is essential for you to frame the context of your study. The central reason why you are conducting the study will lie at the heart of the manuscript, once you’ve started writing. In the formulaic approach (see Part III), it will be verbalised at the end of the introduction. All parts of the methodology will explain how you approached this central aim. So if you feel that you still don’t know what the objective of a certain chapter is, then make sure you discuss it with your advisor so that you know before you start. Hypothesising After Results are Known (HARKing) is the practice of creating your hypothesis once the results are in and you’ve done some preliminary data analyses to see what is significant (Forstmeier, Wagenmakers &amp; Parker, 2017). HARKing has become prevalent in science because of the confirmation bias by journals (only accepting papers that can statistically accept the alternative hypothesis), especially those with higher impact factor. Increasing chances of confirmation bias, or a Type I error, is not desirable as you are more likely to accept the alternative hypothesis when it is not correct. Alternatively, you should seriously consider preregistering your aims to remain transparent. References Forstmeier W, Wagenmakers E-J, Parker TH. 2017.

The introduction serves to inform the reader about why this particular hypothesis was chosen, introducing both the dependent and independent (response and determinate) variables, as well as the presumed mechanism by which the hypothesis can be falsified (or upheld; Figure 16.1).

It should come as no surprise to you that the big ideas that we seek can be found in the literature. Your challenge is to find the big ideas that apply in your own discipline. Although we cannot provide individual answers, there follow some ideas about how to approach these concepts, and practically go about finding the big ideas that are applicable to your study. 16.1.1 Tinbergen’s (1963) four questions In his (1963) paper, Tinbergen posed four questions that he showed could be answered independently of each other, but that together could explain any observed biological trait. These questions are often laid out on a grid (Table 16.1) as this shows how they are pieced together to provide an explanation of the trait. TABLE 16.1: Tinbergen’s (1963) four questions. Stemming from his seminal paper On aims and methods of ethology, Tinbergen’s four questions are widely believed to be of use in addressing the study any biological trait. - Contemporary Chronicle Proximate Mechanism: What is the anatomical or physiological structure of the trait? Ontogeny: How does the trait develop in individuals? Ultimate Adaptive value: Why has the function of the trait influenced fitness? Phylogeny: What is the phylogenetic history that led to the trait? Note that the first two questions are both proximate in that they explain the structure of the trait and its developed. The last two questions are evolutionary (or ultimate), to determine how the trait is influenced by selection. Although Tinbergen (1963) originally conceived these questions to explore behavioural traits, these four questions are used more widely as big ideas that enable biologists to determine proximate and ultimate causes of any trait that they wish to study, either independently of each other, or in synthesis to provide an overall picture. If you haven’t done so already, it would be worth spending time to determine how many of Tinbergen’s four questions have been answered for your own study system. 16.1.2 A hierarchy of hypotheses There are quite a few papers that synthesise hypotheses in various areas of biology. Here I provide a few to get you started. Ask your advisor about relevant reviews of hypotheses in your area of biological sciences. For example, here are some theories and hypotheses in ecology (Catford, Jansson &amp; Nilsson, 2009; Vellend, 2010; Travassos-Britto et al., 2021), while these wide ranging papers about so-called ‘laws’ in biology and ecology (Lawton, 1999; Dhar &amp; Giuliani, 2010). Each of these papers will give you a list of big ideas, together with the citations for seminal papers that have built them. Clearly, you will need to find the papers that set out these big ideas in your own discipline. You will note that many of the theories are very old, with some dating back to Darwin. You can think of the way that such ideas are structured as a hierarchy of hypotheses (Figure 16.2). Building such a hierarchy of ideas in your own specialist subject area is good reference material to prompt critical reading and reflection. You may want to take this structure forward when thinking how to introduce your PhD chapters. FIGURE 16.2: A hierarchy of hypotheses can be used to help determine your Big Idea. A useful structure for thinking about how hypotheses are structured was presented by Heger &amp; Jeschke (2018) in what they termed the Hierarchy of Hypotheses. Of course, there are many ways to approach and test these theories, but if you don’t know about them, your work may actually make a considerable contribution to upholding or refuting them, but go totally unrecognised. When the significance of your work isn’t realised, it’s unlikely that it’ll be widely read and cited. Let’s face it, if all the effort of the work that we put into papers is just going to get buried, then is it really worth it? The work that we do is also expensive, so making it as relevant as we can to as wide an audience as possible is something that we should be concerned about. So, I encourage you to stand on the shoulders of giants (Figures 22.1 by using big ideas in your introduction. Make sure that the data that you collect can actually be used to respond to some of these big ideas. Then make sure that you cite them, giving them the importance that they deserve (yes, even as key words) so that others can find your work, and you might even find that one day, your work has shoulders that are broad enough for others to stand on! The take-home message Reading the literature can really expand your mind and broaden your horizons. When undertaking a literature review, take the time to think about not only what has been tested, but what could have been. Make a list of theories and hypotheses in your own field and try to rank them in a hierarchy. References Catford JA, Jansson R, Nilsson C. 2009.

The reason for this is that it is very easy to get lost when you are writing. Scientific writing, what you will have in your thesis, is necessarily concise and technical relying on arguments and citations - all things that we will cover in this second part of the book. In your attempts to include all of these aspects in your writing, it is very easy to get lost and forget what it was that you were aiming to convey to the reader. The best way that you can ensure that you are going to meet your aims is to write your plan down in the form of an outline. An outline will contain all of the ideas that you have to include in the written text. You should already have papers that you have read that you want to cite, a hypothesis or question that you want to test, and variables that you want to test. You can start by getting all of these ideas down into a document - as a mindmap on paper or as a computer file - remembering to include the aim of why it is that you are including this information in your writing. Next, you will need to plan the order of your text. Your goal is to write in order to clearly communicate to the reader. I suggest that you begin to plan out your formula as a bullet-point outline (Figure 17.1). Start by writing a general sentence for the subject of each paragraph. Then use sub-points to plan each sentence within the paragraph. Lastly, annotate these with citations that you want to use. Personally, I’d prefer to see the bare outline, and then a fleshed outline before you start the writing proper. This allows advisor and student to get on the same page to be sure that what is planned is thought out. FIGURE 17.1: Example of an outline draft of the introduction. In this outline taken from Measey et al. (2020), paragraphs are paragraphs are indicated by the solid dots, and points to make inside the paragraphs by hollow dots. Each paragraph has an argument sketched out within it. In the above example, you may not know what EICAT and SEICAT are (they are scoring systems used for environmental - EICAT - or socio-economic - SEICAT - impacts of alien species), but I would hope that you can follow the broad argument of the introduction explaining why the study should be done. 17.1 Modifying your outline Writing is a dynamic process, and things can change quite suddenly. You can find a new paper that you hadn’t read before which changes your introduction or discussion completely. You can hand your text to someone else to read and they can point out a fundamental flaw in your logic. All of these things and more might mean that you need to modify your outline. That’s ok. It’s normal. But you should go back to your outline and make the changes there before you carry on with your writing. If you modify your text but don’t change your outline, it will become too easy to get lost and forget your aims. The aims can change, but keeping a record of the the new aims is essential otherwise you will have nothing to check your thesis chapter with once it is finished. Moreover, you may not be able to remember why you changed the outline or even what the aim was for your text. When you modify your outline, make sure that it still makes sense in the context of the entire chapter, and that you are not about to lose a crucial component of the thesis. 17.2 Next flesh out the outline with citations In the next stage, ‘fleshing out’, I ask that citations for statements above be added along with any examples. Figure 17.2 is an example of the citations added to paragraph 4 above. FIGURE 17.2: Example of a fleshed out outline of a paragraph in the introduction. In this outline taken from Measey et al. (2020), citations and relevant figures have been inserted for each of the statements. 17.3 An outline for your paragraph Even if you don’t have your entire chapter planned, you can use an outline to plan what you are going to write in a paragraph. Within this, you can flesh out the contents of sentences before you start writing. 17.4 Lastly it’s time to write the text And once you have the fleshed out outline, it’s time to start writing your first draft. Remember that the best way to start writing is to do just that. It’s unlikely that your first effort will be the one that you will finally submit. But start writing. Then read, go back and polish. And keep polishing until you achieve your goal. Having the outline will keep you from forgetting what you planned to say. Once you have the outline my suggestion is always to write in the same document, so that you can quickly refer to what you planned. A common mistake is to delete the plan too early in the writing process. After a lot of revisions and polishing it is all too easy to forget the aim and if you don’t have a copy the temptation is to make something up that fits the text you have. This is why it is important to keep your outline and always refer back to it to make sure that you are on target. 17.5 Keep your outline You are going to need your outline later on once you have finished writing, so it is important to keep it. It doesn’t matter if you have modified the outline, but you need to keep it so that you can check that you have still included all of the important points that you wanted to make before you started. Once you have finished, you will have a different perspective on these points, and that’s ok. However, you do want to make sure that you didn’t throw away anything important between the planning and the writing. If you are unsure about how important something previously included was, it is very easy to check by giving the text to a colleague or your advisor to read. Ask them whether there is sufficient information for the reader, or if something is missing. If they spot what you left out, then this is a sure sign you have to put it back in. But if they think it’s fine, maybe you didn’t need it.

This paragraph starts with a topic sentence which contains the principle idea that citations are needed for examples. The following sentences put this idea into the context of your study. This should be based on examples from existing literature with the corresponding in-text citations provided (Smith et al. 2017; Jones 2018). You can use examples in your paragraph to make your point. For examples, Smith and Jones (2017) carried out a study that showed that examples without citations have no credibility for readers. And this was backed up by another study by Jones and Smith (2018), which provided further evidence for the need to provide examples. Once you’ve provided your evidence, and introduced any covariates that you need to, like the use of literature for examples, then you are ready to sum up and link. After reading this paragraph, the reader will know why citations are needed for examples, and they’ll be ready to read more about the topic of writing a paragraph in more detail. In the paragraph above, the topic sentence is bold, the supporting sentences are normal font, and the clincher is in italics. 18.1 Topic sentence A topic sentence allows the reader to understand quickly the idea/topic you are putting forward in the paragraph. It must be in the context in which you are going to develop the same topic. There’s no point in just mentioning a topic in passing or using it in a different way than you will later. Make your topic sentence relatively simple. Don’t be tempted to add multiple clauses. If the topic sentence is too complex, you’ll lose your reader right at the beginning of the paragraph. 18.2 Supporting sentences Supporting sentences convey all the relevant information to the reader. They are going to be statements that are well cited, showing readers where the original ideas came from. Be sure to keep these sentences on topic, and regularly refer back to your outline to make sure that you keep to the original objective of the paragraph. These are the meat of the paragraph and it’s really important to get them right. If you are writing about differences, then state which way the difference is. For example, if tulips are larger than lillies, then say this. Telling your audience that something is different than something else only ends up leaving them guessing about the directionality. There’s no point in drip dripping this information through. Set it down in as little space as possible so that your reader doesn’t get bored. Sentences within the meat of the paragraph interact, and there’s a great example to show how this is done here. These interactions usually dwell around pertinent variables (such as those that you are going to deal with in your paper). By using the same or similar words within the paragraph, you are able to demonstrate to the reader how those different points interact. While repeating the names of the variables, or their abbreviations, can be helpful, repeating descriptive words becomes quite tedious to the reader. Repeatedly reading the same ideas repeated over and over quickly bores the reader. Bored readers are less likely to take in what you write, even if you are repeating the same information (yes, I’m repeating myself - boring isn’t it). It will also give the reader the impression that your vocabulary is very limited. These days you can do a quick right click on a highlighted word to get a drop down list of synonyms (Figure 18.1). This can allow you to go back and replace your repeated word with: recurrent, frequent, recurring, repetitive, constant or continual. That’s more than enough to spice up the paragraph. However, if you’re not sure whether a word is correctly replacing another, ask a friend to read it. FIGURE 18.1: How to quickly get a synonym to make your paragraph more diverse. An example of the synonym function in Microsoft Word (other wordprocessors are available) - right click on the highlighted word. Your supporting sentences are best built in the formula of an argument. 18.3 The magic of threes We can learn a lot about writing convincingly in science by borrowing from storytelling, and one of the greatest lessons in storytelling involves the magic of threes (Angler, 2020). In putting together your paragraph, you can use the magic of threes to break your dialogue into three parts: thesis, antithesis and synthesis (a, b and a+b). Think of it this way: there’s a standard explanation of how a phenomenon that you want to investigate interacts with the variable of your choice (thesis). Then there’s some contradictory evidence that suggests that the standard explanation is not necessarily correct (antithesis). Lastly, there is your approach to investigate exactly how the variable and phenomenon interact which should explain (or at least advance our understanding) of how the variable and the phenomenon are related (synthesis). It may be that this construct should be fleshed out into three paragraphs instead of three sentences within a paragraph. You won’t be able to construct every paragraph with the magic of threes, but once you have learned this rule, you’ll be able to use it to help emphasise important points in your manuscript that you want the reader to remember as they move forwards. What if your list is two instead of three? Well, then you’ll lose the magic, but maybe you can think it through it again? If you have two, then you normally have three by means of the combination of the two (a, b and a+b). What follows is more advice about telling a good story: using an example and avoiding being boring: i.e. replacing those long lists with a maximum of three items. 18.4 Use an example Examples are a very powerful way of conveying ideas in a short amount of space. Don’t replace your paragraph with an example, but do use an example if it shows the reader just what you want. You should be able to do this in a sentence (or two), but if you’re tempted to go on, it’s probably not a good example. Because the first paragraph sets out ideas, it’s unlikely that an example there will be a good idea there. 18.5 Avoid lists I’m not a big fan of paragraphs which are simply a long list with little or no thought offered. The worst ones are where there are so many citations along the way that it’s really hard to pick out what is a sentence and what is citation. I understand that it’s important to show precedent and that there is merit in showing how widespread an idea is over taxa or in different disciplines. You never find these lists in journals where words and/or citations are limited, which suggests that you can dispense with them. Instead, you can avoid long lists by pulling them into themes. Once you’ve managed to get three themes, you’ll find that you can work them into your paper time and again. For example, each theme might well be worth a separate paragraph or section in the discussion. 18.6 The last sentence of the paragraph: the clincher Once you’ve conveyed all of the information that you planned to impart in your outline, it’s time for the last sentence. This should conclude the evidence that you’ve provided on your topic. Try not to make it lame. For example: “This shows that little work has been done.” One of my pet hates is authors who insist on telling us that “little work has been done”, as if this was a justification for doing anything. Instead, make it a real clincher about why the topic is important, or how and why you will tackle it. Instead (or as well if you can), you may want this sentence to link on to another paragraph (topic), especially if flow is important at that part of your outline (see below). If you have just constructed a paragraph with thesis, antithesis and synthesis, then your clincher might be simply to underline that your approach in the paper is to investigate the synthesis. Either way, make sure that your last sentence is on topic, and one that sticks in the readers’ minds. 18.7 Above all - read it! Your paragraph is not finished until you’ve read it. Reading is an essential part of writing that cannot be emphasised enough. Does your paragraph say what you planned in your outline? If your paragraph and any other text doesn’t make sense to you, it sure won’t impress anyone else. If you can’t bear to read it through immediately, then do it after you’ve written two or three paragraphs. I suggest that you don’t wait until you’ve finished the manuscript. Rather get the text right as you go along. 18.8 How does the paragraph fit into the flow? So now we’ve gone over the formula, it’s time to take a step back and look again at the paragraph in the context of your outline. Remember that the paragraph represents a single subject but that it is still just part of the manuscript as a whole and you need that to flow from beginning to end. This means that it’s not enough to write each paragraph in isolation, but to think of the way in which they link together as a whole, especially when you are trying to make a logical argument. You should be using the outline to provide the logic in the flow of your argument, fleshed out with the relevant references. If you already know this well, then writing the paragraph will just be a question of styling the outline. Remember that there is a purpose to your paragraph. You have an argument to make the reader understand. Don’t be tempted to include information that is distracting or moving away from the flow of that argument. I am very fond of ending a paragraph on a linking sentence. Essentially, this shows how two ideas are connected in the last sentence. This really helps with getting the flow of an introduction or discussion, but linking sentences are not always the best way to end a paragraph. Sometimes there’s no option but to change the subject completely, and then you should go for the clincher idea (see above). For example, you may want to end the paragraph by seeding a new twist on the paragraph’s idea. 18.9 Seeding ideas The introduction sets out the established literature in order to put your study in context, but your discussion provides you with an opportunity to present new ideas, or to turn and twist existing ideas in a new way. Once you’ve got a good idea of what these are, I like to seed the introduction with hints as to what these might be. Sowing seeds early in a manuscript will provide the reader with hints as to where you are going. Writing these seeds as questions is a really good way of sowing them into an introduction. You can then go on to answer them (if only partly) in the discussion. Beware though, there’s no point in asking a major question in the introduction to which your data has no relevance! 18.10 Breaking the rules Just as in the other instructions on formulaic paper writing, when writing a paragraph, you shouldn’t feel totally constrained so that you can’t break the rules. Breaking the rules can set you free, and much of what you read that really stands out will do this. However, it’s much easier to break the rules and get it wrong, than break them and get it right. The idea of this chapter was to help you get started, not to communicate with those who are already writing great stuff. So if you’re already great, don’t break it! 18.11 Some common paragraph mistakes Don’t start your paragraph by linking back to the previous point. Start with your new topic sentence. If you aren’t ready to change the topic, you aren’t ready for a new paragraph. Don’t start the paragraph with an unsubstantiated or over-inflated claim (keep it calm and within the bounds of what you are citing). Similarly, don’t start with a trivial caveat. And don’t start with a list or a long string of citations. Don’t let your paragraph get too long. It is said that 250 words are the threshold. If you haven’t covered what you wanted to in your outline within 250 words, then you need to rethink your outline for that paragraph! Definitely don’t split a paragraph that’s too long into two! If you started without an outline, it’s never too late to go back and write an outline. Simply write down what you are trying to say (as a set of bullet points), and why (see below for an example). Your paragraph should have more than one citation in it. If you find yourself citing the same paper several times in the same paragraph, then there’s something wrong with your outline, and the way that you are reading and citing papers (see below). Remember that what you write is about making your own argument from the literature, and not copying others’ arguments. The English grammar rules apply when writing science. I can’t go into these in detail here as they are legion and complex. However, here are a few mistakes that are often made by those writing in science: You should not start a sentence with an abbreviated genus. Instead, write the genus name in full. You should not start a sentence with a numeral. If you have to use the number as the first word, write it out. Otherwise, rearrange your sentence. . Make sure that acronyms are spelt out on first use (this may be needed for each section) References Angler MW. 2020.

The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) platforms brings with it new issues around writing generally, including writing your PhD thesis. These bots are already widely available in early 2023, with both Microsoft (through their company OpenAI) and Google launching ChatGPT and Gemini, respectively. Note that Google originally launched as Bard in early 2023, but then later released as an update known as Gemini. There are already publications that list ChatGPT as an author (O’Connor &amp; ChatGPT, 2023; Mijwil, Aljanabi &amp; ChatGPT, 2023) in acknowledgement that a large amount of the text therein had been generated by the bot. More AI writing tools are going to be coming online in the near future. Microsoft’s plan to integrate the ChatGPT into Bing and the Bing platform directly into their office suite, means that as an author you may unwittingly use AI generated automated suggestions inside your word processor without realising it. Thus, you should be interested in knowing whether such tools can be used to help you in your own writing. If you haven’t already tried (Owens, 2023), once you do you will understand the tantalising possibility that they could be used to replace your needing to write. In this chapter I set out some ideas about how you might use AI to help you write, as well as some things that you should consider if you do go that route. Bear in mind that this field is moving extremely quickly and it will not be possible to keep up with every change happening in AI all of the time. Instead, I am to discuss more generically about how to use these tools. This field is moving very fast Bear in mind when you read this that the original chapter was written in March 2023, with updates nearly every month since then. This current version was compiled on 23 September, 2024. If you think that the content here (or elsewhere in the book) is out of date, or needs additional text, please let me know (see here). 19.1 What is a Large Language Model (LLM)? Back in February 2023, I decided to ask ChatGPT and Bard (as it was then) to contribute to this chapter by describing themselves. My input text: “I am writing a chapter for a book on academic writing and I want you to describe ChatGPT/Bard in your own words”. Here’s what they said: ChatGPT (March 2023) As a language model based on the GPT-3.5 architecture, ChatGPT is a sophisticated artificial intelligence program that has been trained on a massive amount of text data from various sources. It is designed to understand natural language and generate responses that are contextually relevant and coherent. ChatGPT uses deep learning algorithms to analyze text inputs and predict the most probable next word or phrase, based on patterns and associations it has learned from its training data. This allows it to generate human-like responses to a wide range of questions and prompts, from simple queries to complex conversations. One of the unique features of ChatGPT is its ability to understand and generate text in multiple languages, making it a valuable tool for communication and collaboration across different cultures and regions. Additionally, it has been used for a wide variety of applications, including language translation, content creation, and customer service. Overall, ChatGPT represents a significant breakthrough in artificial intelligence research and has the potential to transform the way we communicate and interact with technology. Bard (March 2023) Bard is a large language model, also known as a conversational AI or chatbot trained to be informative and comprehensive. I am trained on a massive amount of text data, and I am able to communicate and generate human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and questions. For example, I can provide summaries of factual topics or create stories. I am still under development, but I have learned to perform many kinds of tasks, including: I will try my best to follow your instructions and complete your requests thoughtfully. I will use my knowledge to answer your questions in a comprehensive and informative way, even if they are open ended, challenging, or strange. I will generate different creative text formats of text content, like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc. I will try my best to fulfill all your requirements. I am excited to be able to help you with your academic writing, and I hope that I can be a valuable tool for you. Gemini (May 2024) - note the shift from using first person (Bard) to third person (Gemini). It’s a deliberate change made by Google. Gemini is actually the new name for what was formerly known as Bard. It’s like a more powerful and upgraded version. Here’s the breakdown of the key differences: Underlying Tech: Bard primarily relied on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for processing information. Gemini utilizes a transformer-based design, which is considered more powerful for various tasks. Training Data: Gemini is trained on a much larger and more diverse dataset compared to Bard. This includes text, code, and even images, allowing it to understand and respond to a wider range of prompts and questions. Capabilities: Bard was focused on text-based interactions. Gemini, however, has multimodal capabilities. This means it can not only process text but also understand and generate different formats of data, including images and potentially even video. In short, Gemini is designed to be more versatile and powerful than Bard, with the ability to handle complex tasks and integrate with other Google tools more seamlessly. To summarise, LLMs are trained on an exceptionally large amount of data and use AI to first understand what you are asking it, and second pull out of their training set what they need to reply to your user input. The key then is that whereas previous chat bots had (relatively) small training sets and limited ability to understand user input, these new LLMs have vast amount of data. 19.2 Large language models have been around for a while Although at the beginning of 2023 we are seeing a large number of popular articles about ChatGPT, the use of language platforms in writing in general, including writing in the Biological Sciences, has been around for a while. If English is not your first language, then you already know how incredibly useful it is to enter text into a translation app in your own language and get English back. Some years ago, these translation platforms were rather literal, simply translating each word and providing text back that was barely usable. Today, with the help of AI, the translation that returns is more often than not a reasonable sounding (near) grammatically correct translation of what was entered. Hence, if you have used such translations in your own writing, then you should have already considered the a lot of contents of this chapter, and if you haven’t then you need to read on. Interestingly, when ChatGPT was asked to provide text in French and Arabic, it failed to produce coherent text (Seghier, 2023), although it is possible that this will change over time as it becomes more sophisticated. It is interesting to note the difference between the claim that ChatGPT made (above) and this assertion from Seghier (2023) a few months ago. Whether or not ChatGPT has improved has yet to be tested. 19.3 Output from ChatGPT cannot be trusted The first, and perhaps most important issue, about using ChatGPT outputs in your own writing is that you cannot trust it to generate text that is factually correct or unbiased. Indeed, OpenAI who own and administer ChatGPT readily admit that their bot can produce factually incorrect statements and is often biased in its output (Owens, 2023). Similarly, when you start to use Google’s Bard, it forces you to click on an button to acknowledge that text generated may not be correct. Because these bots use data on the internet to generate the basis of the text that they generates, they are prone to providing the internet consensus about popular topics, and studies have already shown that there is a bias in what is produced (McGee, 2023a,b). This means that you should be carefully checking any AI text that is generated before you add it to your chapter or manuscript. In particular, you should never trust a AI generated text with citations (see below). 19.3.1 Plagiarism by AI There is the chance that your AI tool is going to plagiarise text that it finds on the internet, and so you may unwittingly be pasting the words of another author into your own text (see more on plagiarism here). Some authors consider that even if the AI is programmed to avoid plagiarism, using this text in any way should be considered as plagiarism (Salvagno, Taccone &amp; Gerli, 2023). Certainly, if you use AI generated text and then claim that you have written this yourself, then this is clearly plagiarism. In this case, the plagiarism is due to the false claim that you wrote the text. Perhaps a more fundamental consideration is whether AI will require us to redefine what we mean by plagiarism. Certainly, this is a philosophical consideration that right now (at the start of 2023) you will need to decide for yourself, although as more AI tools come online and are more commonly available, I think that many journal guidelines will be prescriptive on their use (for example see here). Plagiarism can be thought of as taking someone else’s writing without attribution. Another definition of plagiarism is pretending that someone else’s work is your own. While these two definitions may appear interchangeable at first sight, when considering use of text from an AI, you might only infringe the attribution rule while the AI is programmed to infringe the pretense. In other words, if the AI is not a person, then following the first definition of AI you have not taken someone else’s writing. However, you might consider that as the AI itself was the product of someone else’s work, then they are the person (or group of people) that generated that text, and so the work should be attributed to them. This then brings you to the second definition of plagiarism. But what if that group of people don’t ask for any attribution or acknowledgement? Should you still give them as an author or put them into the acknowledgements? Moreover, could this team really be said to have generated the text when they have created software that searches text written by others on the internet and then collate and rewrite it? The huge number of content creators on the internet can never be acknowledged individually. Another way of thinking about this might be to consider human interactions in writing text. If, for example, I help some colleagues with the English text of a manuscript and they offer to place my name in the acknowledgements, but I tell them that there is really no need. Should they still acknowledge me even though I have told them not to? A further example might be the use of different layers in GIS that have been generated by different people. Many journals now insist that there is attribution to these layers in the legend of the figure or in the acknowledgements. We might legitimately ask whether this is necessary when those layers are freely available and have a non-attribution Creative Commons licence (see here)? Clearly, the definition of plagiarism will need some work in the light of new abilities for AIs to write text. What I see happening is that both universities and publishers are asking students / authors to declare that they have not generated any text using AI. This is a catch-all and will mean that you simply cannot use AI generated text. To me, the possibility that by using AI generated text verbatim you could be using someone else’s words means that you should avoid this. The same goes whether this is a translation from a large language platform or a new chat bot style AI. Using such platforms as tools is certainly acceptable, while using their text verbatim is probably an example of false attribution. My own view is that any attempt to be overly restrictive on the use of AI generated text is bound to fail as AI itself becomes increasingly more sophisticated and widespread. Instead, I share the view of Lim (2023) that it is better to embrace and learn how to use AI as a tool. Learn about what it can do, as well as its limitations. There is an entire chapter on plagiarism (in Part II) where AI generated text is covered, and I’d advise you to read this to learn more. 19.3.2 Ethics In addition to the attribution of authorship, and potential plagiarism issues, you should also be aware of the ethical component of using text from an AI tool. The kind of ethics points that come up are similar to those that are raised by paper mills (Salvagno, Taccone &amp; Gerli, 2023). This issue is covered comprehensively elsewhere: see Chapter on when you should be an author in Measey (2022). 19.3.3 Failure to learn Lastly, a great reason not to use AI to help you write you thesis chapters is that you will learn next to nothing this way. Even if you aren’t going to continue in science, writing a PhD is a significant learning experience, and you will benefit in being able to write reports and other types of documents since you will have had the experience of going from having nothing, planning what to write and then executing this. Don’t underestimate the importance of this ability. The reality is that once you have accomplished writing your thesis you will have an important and marketable skill. Using AI to generate text, even if it gets to the point in the future when it generates something useful, will impact your ability to generate text yourself. I can imagine a future where far fewer people are learning how to write because there is so much AI generated text. In this future, having the ability to write yourself will give you an advantage that should be valued. 19.4 Positive aspects of using AI It will not come as any surprise that many authors often find it difficult to get started with their writing. The classic image is starting at a blank piece of paper, or these days a flashing cursor on an empty screen. In this book, I provide a lot of suggestions about how to get started with your writing task: using a phrasebank to generate text formula for writing a logical argument using a formula making an outline but can ChatGPT provide another opportunity when you don’t know how to start? I think that it can. 19.4.1 Use AI as a tool Essentially, if you want to try using AI to help you write, use it as a tool. Don’t try to use it to replace your own writing. That will likely end in a poor product, and could possibly end with factually incorrect or biased text that you won’t want to be associated with your name, and clearly not something that you should want your advisor to read. Getting started is often a struggle and I regularly suggest that students start by writing something/anything to fill out their outline, even if all of that text gets replaced at a later date. This is a way that you could use AI as a tool. Produce your own outline, because you do still need to plan your chapter, but then try using an AI to flesh this out. Read through the output and get inspired. Hopefully, this will end by helping you to write your own text, replacing everything that the AI has produced. But do not copy and paste it into your document. Use the AI to help you get stated but don’t copy it. Just like you might read the text of an article and that helps you get some understanding, you can use AI generated text in the same way. But if you copy and paste it, you’ll start on a slippery slope towards plagiarism and potential disqualification. Be aware that AI can get it wrong. Back at the start, ChatGPT was dated to a portion of the internet from September 2021 (Azamfirei, Kudchadkar &amp; Fackler, 2023). It cannot access the internet and so you will not get anything more recent. Whereas Bard is trained from Google search results, Wikipedia, The Common Crawl and other publicly available datasets. This has now changed, but it may well be that the AI you use has not accessed the most recent research. Currently, you are a much better researcher and judge of the written work than any AI. So, don’t believe what it tells you without checking everything! 19.4.1.1 Using ChatGPT to get started: an example I have tried this approach below and you can judge the outcome for yourself. First, I write the text outline, and second I provide each point to ChatGPT. For the following outline, I provided the outline statement (each bullet point) in quotes and prefixed it with “Write a sentence with citations on:”…” In this example, the outline below is similar to what I would produce when writing an outline for the first two paragraphs of an introduction to a manuscript on invasive fish: Invasive species are a growing global problem invasive species cost a huge amount of money to governments invasive species are a threat to biodiversity invasive species impact people’s quality of life Freshwater habitats have been particularly impacted by global change important changes have occurred to freshwater systems after the introduction of invasive fish invasive fish have been added to both rivers and lakes large numbers of introductions of invasive fish have already occurred globally, and are ongoing The following text was generated by ChatGPT (on 19 March 2023) given the primer text above, and the stipulation that it should produce a sentence with citations. I have simply combined the output text into the paragraphs as might be expected in the introduction to a manuscript: According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), invasive species are a growing global problem that pose a significant threat to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The National Wildlife Federation (NWF) reports that invasive species cost the United States government an estimated $120 billion annually in damages and control measures (Masterson, 2018). The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) states that invasive species are one of the main threats to global biodiversity, causing species extinctions, altering ecosystems, and reducing ecological resilience (CBD, 2021). A study conducted by the University of California, Davis, found that invasive species can have negative impacts on human health, recreation, and property values, affecting people’s quality of life in areas where they are present (Koch et al., 2011). A global analysis of freshwater ecosystems found that they are among the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, pollution, and invasive species, with declines in biodiversity and ecosystem services being reported worldwide (Vörösmarty et al., 2010). Studies have shown that the introduction of invasive fish species can cause significant ecological and economic changes in freshwater systems, including alterations in food webs, declines in native fish populations, and reduced recreational and commercial fishing opportunities (Leprieur et al., 2008; Ricciardi &amp; MacIsaac, 2011). Invasive fish species have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced into both rivers and lakes, causing significant ecological impacts and economic costs globally (Savini et al., 2010; Phelps et al., 2016). A study by Jeschke et al. (2014) found that over 12,000 introductions of invasive fish species have already occurred globally, with new introductions continuing to happen at an increasing rate, highlighting the urgent need for effective prevention and management strategies. The following text was generated by Bard (on 27 March 2023) using identical input format: Invasive species are a growing global problem, with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) estimating that they cause $1.4 trillion in economic damages annually (IUCN, 2016; WWF, 2017). Invasive species cost governments a huge amount of money to control and eradicate, with the US National Invasive Species Council estimating that the cost in the US is $120 billion annually. (NISC, 2017). Invasive species are a major threat to biodiversity, as they can outcompete native species for resources, introduce new diseases, and alter habitats (IUCN, 2016). Invasive species impact people’s quality of life by causing economic losses, disrupting ecosystems, and harming human health. Economic losses can occur when invasive species damage crops, forests, and other natural resources. Disrupted ecosystems can lead to the decline of native species and the loss of ecosystem services, such as water purification and flood control. Harm to human health can occur when invasive species spread diseases or cause allergic reactions. Freshwater habitats have been particularly impacted by global change, with climate change, invasive species, and habitat loss all playing a role. Climate change is causing changes in temperature, precipitation, and water flow that are altering freshwater habitats. Invasive species are non-native species that can outcompete native species for resources, introduce new diseases, and alter habitats. Habitat loss is occurring due to human activities such as development, agriculture, and mining. The impacts of these changes are already being felt, with many freshwater species in decline. If we do not take action to address these challenges, the consequences for freshwater ecosystems and the people who rely on them will be severe. “Invasive species can cause major changes to freshwater ecosystems, including the decline of native species, the alteration of food webs, and the spread of diseases. For example, the introduction of the invasive Asian carp to the Great Lakes has led to the decline of native fish populations and the alteration of the food web” (IUCN, 2016). “Invasive fish, such as Asian carp and largemouth bass, have been added to both rivers and lakes, often through illegal releases or escapes from aquaculture facilities.” (IUCN, 2016). “Large numbers of introductions of invasive fish have already occurred globally, and are ongoing. Between 1970 and 2000, an estimated 7,000 species of fish were introduced to new areas (IUCN, 2016).” For full details of the input and output of each sentence, please see my blog here for ChatGPT and here for Bard. 19.4.1.2 The results of my experiment are that both bots failed As an exercise, I have tried to find each of these citations in an attempt to determine whether ChatGPT was accurate. You can find the results in full here. So, it’s bad news for anyone who might want to try to rely on it for writing referenced statements for their PhD. Although my initial assessment was that the text looked good most of what was attributed to the citations given was fraudulent, when the paper could be found. The text sounds good, but the citations are bogus, and that’s no use for you, or anybody else. Potentially it’s even worse than bad sounding text as it sounds credible. Similar attempts to fact check ChatGPT generated text have also found it to be completely fabricated (Azamfirei, Kudchadkar &amp; Fackler, 2023). I have not attempted to verify the output for the Bard output as there were very few citations given and all are reports, not original works, and so would not be readily accepted by anyone. Interestingly, Bard repeated my input text as part of its output, even encasing it in quotes. Bard’s excessive use of quotes when I asked it to write a sentence is also noteworthy. It is unclear whether it had problems generating text, or whether using quotes was considered a viable alternative to generating text. Bard also had problems restricting itself to a single sentence output. Getting the citations right, and making your text fit what they find is where the skill comes in. Most statements sounded good, and were certainly on message, but the citations were sometimes vague and when they could be pinned down turned out to be about other subjects or did not contain the information claimed. For information on how to cite, see the chapter in Part II. 19.4.2 Were the bots a complete fail? Yes, I would say that having checked the references for ChatGPT, most of what was said sounded good, but could not be backed up by the citations given, in the cases where they could be found. For this reason, I am confident in calling this experiment a complete fail, not because there was no truth, but because it was mostly misleading (incorrect citations and unhelpful misdirection to correct citations). For most of you who are trying to write their PhD thesis, I would suggest that you are completely wasting your time to try this approach with ChatGPT. This doesn’t mean that you can’t use it as an to writing, but that you can’t rely on it to produce anything that is factually correct. Perhaps ChatGPT is getting all these citation uses wrong because it is looking to see how other people use citations? This is not unreasonable, as mis-citing is a real problem. But having this platform reinforcing false citation habits is the last thing you need. Given that it’s taken me several hours to check two paragraphs, I feel no hesitation in suggesting that you avoid using ChatGPT in this way – and if you do, beware – it probably got it all wrong. 19.4.3 Can I use AI to create a first draft? If you are all out of ideas and staring at a blank page, then you could use the AI bot to help you generate some first ideas for text. However, I would add a heavy caution not to rely on anything it generates, and to be very cautious with respect to plagiarism. Overall, I’d suggest that you only use it as a last resort, and then only do so with a plan to substantially change and rewrite the text afterwards. 19.4.4 Did the AI pass the plagiarism checker Using a plagiarism checker (TurnItIn), the output from ChatGPT suggested that: No plagiarism was found. However, text generated by Bard was found to have plagiarism at 21%. Some of this included text that was already in quotes, but there was additional text that had been lifted from non-cited sources on the internet. NB This was done before TurnItIn launched the trial of their “AI writing detection capability”. It will be interesting to repeat this exercise and test whether or not plagiarism detection is possible. I suspect that if plagiarism checkers, already in use in many institutions and publishing platforms, release additional tools to detect AI writing generation, then this may set the policy at these same institutions. However, this also raises some concerns. What if I write my own original text and it is flagged as AI generated? Will plagiarism tools keep up worth AI improvement? Can I still use AI as a tool to get started? What is the aim of policing AI text generation? are we trying to improve science or improve an ability to write English? 19.5 Will others detect ChatGPT if I use it? Some people claim that they can detect the output from ChatGPT as it lacks the depth and insight that original authors usually have. In other words, the aim of ChatGPT is to produce the words (in a grammatically correct manner), while the aim of an author is to transmit an idea to the reader. As you might expect and hope, AI is not at the point where it can generate the same intent to communicate. In late 2023, an article in Nature (Conroy, 2023) highlighted research by Guillaume Cabanac that had found the phrase “regnerate response” in more than 30 published papers. It is suggested that the authors have been so sloppy with their use of AI that they have also included the text on the button that occurs with the output. The examples spotted include the most crude errors and likely represent a very small proportion of AI generated text now published. The real question remains why so few people are critically reading manuscripts before they are published. Let us not forget that this is not the first time computer generated text has been published by “reputable publishers”. An article from 2014 talks about how use of the crude text generation software SCIgen had been outed in dozens of published papers (Sample, 2014). Now (in March 2024) that I’ve had more than a year to evaluate AI tools that write text, I am still of the opinion that AI is not a solution, but can be used as a crude tool. In essays that students have submitted for assessment, it has been easy to spot those who have used AI to generate their text. How? Because AI gets the facts wrong, but still makes it sound good. These mistakes are really unlikely for a human to make. For example, AI will use real species names to summarise the results from an experiment, but uses the wrong name. The AI interpretation of what the experiment is about and what the findings are is often faulty, and can sometimes be wildly inaccurate. I suspect that students who were more diligent in what they handed in, were unlikely to have gained much advantage to using AI. Maybe it helped them get started, or maybe it helped them find some useful phrases, but there is still little help from generating text and using it without considerable reworking. There will likely be better AI chat bots in the future, and ChatGPT itself is constantly getting feedback from users that should improve its own output. Hence, we can expect that current problems will change. 19.5.1 ChatGPT, or other AI platforms, cannot be an author You may be aware of several articles that are already published with ChatGPT listed in the author line (O’Connor &amp; ChatGPT, 2023; Mijwil, Aljanabi &amp; ChatGPT, 2023). Decisions on whether or not this is allowed are likely to be journal specific. However, some publishing houses are already making journal wide decisions excluding the use of AIs as authors (for example, see here). This is clearly a dynamic process and you should be aware of what is happening in your own field. 19.6 Transparency However you use an AI platform, you should be transparent to your advisor and any colleagues that you publish with about the exact level of use that was involved in generating your text. As a general rule with writing and academia, transparency is the best policy. Some authors have already called for regulations (Salvagno, Taccone &amp; Gerli, 2023). Be aware that journals do update their instructions to authors, so you may need to look for statements on AI text generation. Similarly, familiarise yourself with your institutions requirements for thesis submission, and be careful you do not transgress any recently added rules. 19.6.1 Universities are asking you to declare that text in your thesis is not AI generated It would be worth checking with your institution to find out what their latest guidelines are. I have already received PhD theses to examine where there are declarations made that no text is AI generated. It is very likely that most institutions will make policies on this soon, if they have not done so already. 19.6.2 COPE have already provided guidelines The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) have already provided some guidelines to their members (mostly publishers) on the use of AI (COPE, 2023) which you can find here. In general, these rules emphasise the importance of oversight and transparency in the use of AI tools in decision making. 19.6.3 Publishers now make it a requirement that you declare no text was AI generated Many publishers are now making it a requirement that you declare on submission of a manuscript that it was not AI generated. 19.7 Publishers using AI bots Publishers are very interested in using the text from AI bots to generate lay summaries of articles that are published on their platforms. Certainly, there is evidence that scientists are already using the bots to create their own summaries (Owens, 2023). This is certainly a possible creative use for AIs, but I would be concerned that without careful curation they may be prone to producing factually incorrect or misleading content. If you plan to use AI software to popularise your own science, then I suggest that you carefully read anything that is created and ensure that the text is correctly attributed when you use it. 19.8 Last note This text was written in RMarkdown, without the use of suggestive prompts. AI generated text is written as quotes in the above text. All other text is my own. It will be interesting to look back on this chapter in a decade and see the changes that have emerged in that time.

"],["argument.html", "Chapter 20 Construct a logical argument in your writing 20.1 Arguments in Latin 20.2 Other arguments in English", " Chapter 20 Construct a logical argument in your writing Writing is not straightforward. Your objective is to communicate with a reader, someone who you’ve likely never met. You need to communicate highly complex information. But more than that you need them to see things as you do. You need to provide them with your reasoning and your argument, and have it make sense to them; preferably to the point where they agree with you. To communicate, you need to start from common ground. The beginning of your introduction starts with the most general concepts in the context in which you are writing. The context depends on your audience, and this, in turn, relates to the particular journal that you are writing for. Even if you are writing a thesis, you should pick out a target journal for each of the chapters. Once you’ve established the common ground, you need to carry the reader towards the hypothesis or question that you propose. The easiest way to do this is to make use of a logical argument: A series of statements that introduce a starting premise, provide evidence for and against that premise (perhaps adding in an example that makes your point), point out what missing information would allow reaching a better understanding of said premise, and logically conclude that what you are doing is going to help fill this gap. This logical argument style is most prominent in the early introduction of your manuscript, although the entire introduction could be seen as one long logical argument, with a few smaller more precise arguments being thrown in along the way. You might also use a logical argument in your discussion to explain how you deduce certain inferences from your results, or provide a logical extension for a future study. The following science argumentation model (Table 20.1) is modified from Cope et al. (2013). Try using this model to guide your writing of a paragraph of your introduction (or discussion) where you attempt a logical argument. For a more in depth treatment of using arguments in science, see Toulmin (2003). TABLE 20.1: A framework for a scientific argument. Modified from Cope et al. (2013), this model argument can be followed to provide as a way of getting started. Structure Explanation A position statement / question / hypothesis / theory / problematic This could be the big idea in your manuscript, or one of several competing concepts that you are introducing. The context in which you are writing might mean that this idea theory needs no introduction (e.g. the theory of evolution in the journal Evolution), but you need to be confident that your audience will understand what you are proposing. Remember to cite the person who came up with the idea. Claim 1 One potential explanation or interpretation of the original idea. Evidence: Literature that agrees with this interpretation (could include an example) Reasoning: Your justification that links the evidence to the claim or interpretation. Claim 2 Another potential explanation, of the previous interpretation of the original idea Counter-claims Other possible interpretations or counter-claims. Conclusions Evaluation: your judgement on weighing up the evidence for the idea. If your logical argument doesn’t arrive immediately, don’t force it. Give it some thinking time to let it settle in. I find that logical arguments develop best when I’m not sitting at my desk writing. They come when I’m reading other papers (especially those with well-written arguments), taking a deep, hot bath, or when I’m out running in the mountains. If you are more social, talk through your logical argument with others, perhaps over a cup of coffee. It really helps to keep the ideas turning in your head. Don’t cut yourself off from work thoughts when you are away from work. There are other shorter forms that might suit you better. Consider another classic form of the scientific argument: “compare and contrast” which allows you as a writer to quickly familiarise your reader with some key examples. Another sentence structure to consider is explaining cause and effect. For practical wording examples of both of these classic arguments, see part 2. 20.1 Arguments in Latin From time to time you may come across comments in Latin about arguments that you’ve made in your work. Why do people use Latin and not simply say it in English? What do these phrases actually mean? While you may think that these people are being pompous or trying to demonstrate some scholarly superiority by quoting Latin at you (and you might be right), there is some important reasoning to consider both in the meanings of these argumentum (as they are known in Latin), and the fact that they are as old as Roman scholars, and often much older. This then is the point, that some arguments are faulty, and that this has been known for thousands of years. Here I have provided some of these arguments, and the reasons why they may appear in your thesis in biological sciences. Ad hominem - “To the man” means that the argument attacks the person and not the argument. Non sequitur - “It does not follow”: suggests that one statement in your argument is not linked to the next. This is also known as a logical fallacy, a formal fallacy or a deductive fallacy. Post hoc, ergo propter hoc - “it happened after, so it was caused by”: mistaking cause and effect simply because one thing happened after another. The two events may have been completely unrelated. Reductio ad absurdum - “reduction to absurdity”: attempts to establish a claim by comparing it to an absurd opposite. Novacula Occami - “Occam’s razor”: The idea that the simplest hypothesis, or argument is most likely to be correct. Another way to think of this is if you have two models that you test are equally likely (e.g. within 2 δAICs), the one with the least number of variables should be considered superior. This is also known as the priciple or law of parsimony: lex parsimoniae. 20.2 Other arguments in English Likewise, there are some arguments in English that you will hear time and again. I take the opportunity to also list these here: Correlation does not equal causation - That two events or variables are related when in fact, they are co-incidental. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence - The idea that positive evidence of the existence of a relationship is superior to a lack of the same evidence. This is also known as a Type II error (false negative), where the lack of finding a significant relationship does not lead to a conclusion that the relationship does not exist. Later we discuss how a lack of finding of a significant result leads to confirmation bias in science. Observational selection - “The root of all superstition is that men observe when a thing hits, but not when it misses.” Francis Bacon (1620). This refers to the cherry picking of studies that support your hypothesis while omitting those that do not support it. Later we see how this can be abused when writing a review or even the introduction to your chapter. Straw man - Erecting a false or simplified statement in order to make it easier to attack. False dichotomy - Considering that two extremes of a continuum are the only possible alternatives. We have seen elsewhere how science is built on the works of those that have worked before us. When we construct a logical argument in science, we do so using this scholarly accumulation of knowledge as presented in the literature: citations. That is to say that your claims must be backed up by the literature. To do this, you will need to read that literature and make sure that it can back up your claims. Beware of making a baseless claim. It may be that when researching your question, you come across the same argument using the same literature rehashed time and again in different papers (it happens). Does this give you a green light to do it again? I’d like to think that you already know that there are likely lots of other untapped and better examples out there, and it’d be well worth your while constructing your argument yourself. Beware of copying an argument wholesale. You might well end up getting muddled, or worse perpetuating an error. Better go back and make sure that you understand the original premise and the works that promote or oppose this. Having told you to beware, I’m now going to encourage you to read, because reading is one of the best ways in which you can learn about writing a logical argument. Reading critically will make you aware of when you come across an argument. Ask yourself: Did you understand it? Was it written in a conventional style (as in Table 20.1) If not, how was the style broken with and did this improve or detract from the understanding? In this writing book, I concentrate on providing formulaic approaches to writing, because these are by far the easiest ways for inexperienced writers. However, I encourage you to learn and experiment with writing styles as you become more experienced. Critical reading is one of the best ways to learn about alternative writing styles: reading is probably the best way of improving your writing. Alternatively, and especially if the above hasn’t clicked with you, you can read more about writing a scientific argument (see for example here). And there’s plenty more out there.

Or is it? 21.3 Can storytelling help memory of science?", " Chapter 21 Storytelling in science? I started thinking about this topic some years back as I often need to write popular articles that make some of the science that we do more generally accessible. But then I came across an article by Nick Enfield (2018) that made me think again. ‘No storytelling’ is a comment that I sometimes make when reading drafts of manuscripts, chapters, and even when editing for journals. What do I mean by this? Stories are deterministic. That is to say that the storyteller has an end in mind when they start telling the story (i.e. teleological; see Figure 21.1), and the telling is a way to get to their goal. A story that’s ‘pointless’ will frustrate the audience and won’t engender them to listen to that storyteller again. In a good story, reaching that goal will often result in lots of twists and turns with the goal shrouded in mystery until it is revealed. In a teaching story (like a parable), the goal may be overt, such that the audience relates to the narrative and buys into the same conclusion. If we did science like we tell stories, we would decide on the way the system works before we studied it, and then design the experiment in order to reach our desired goal. You should have recognised by now that this is not the way we do science. This is clearly an undesirable way to go about doing science because we should never prejudice the result that we’ll get from a study before we do it. Hence, writing stories and writing science are different processes. FIGURE 21.1: It’s story time. Are you sitting comfortably?

While it is generally acknowledged that this is a good way to tell a story, it can be a trap when it comes to conducting scientific inquiry. Here, we need to approach science in a very different way to storytelling. When I was doing my PhD I was very frustrated as I had the impression that my advisor knew what result he wanted and designed the study to show it. What probably happened is that he was displaying ‘motivated reasoning’, but the result is known as ‘confirmation bias’. When an experiment failed to meet the expected result, he declared that it had failed. As Frances Bacon so elegantly put it: “Once a man’s understanding has settled on something (either because it is an accepted belief or because it pleases him), it draws everything else also to support and agree with it. And if it encounters a larger number of more powerful countervailing examples, it either fails to notice them, or disregards them, or makes fine distinctions to dismiss and reject them, and all this with much dangerous prejudice, to preserve the authority of its first conceptions.” Francis Bacon (1620) In our work, we read other studies and observations to formulate a question that we frame as a hypothesis. We then devise an experiment that will test this hypothesis in the most objective way, so that we can fairly accept or reject our null hypothesis. 21.2 Science is the very opposite of storytelling. Or is it? I often tend to think of the answer to the right question as the goal of the study. That I don’t know what the answer is, doesn’t spoil the story for me. The important thing is asking the question. An unexpected answer might send us back to thinking more about the system that we are studying and result in a greater revelation. A good example of this is the study published by Becker et al. (2018b). Francois found a (spookily) strong relationship between probability that Rose’s dwarf toadlets survive and local rainfall in the breeding season. More rainfall equals greater survival is what one would automatically think (because frogs like rain), but that wasn’t the result obtained. Francois found that survival increased with less rainfall. It wasn’t until we made the connection between the fact that increased rainfall during the breeding season meant that the toadlets spent more time in puddles, that we understood why their survival was decreasing. As the toadlets aren’t feeding during this time they lose mass, and also expose themselves to increased predation. In a dry year, the toadlets will head back to their subterranean refuges much earlier and continue to pursue ‘safer’ feeding and hiding habits. While we might intuitively feel that a ‘safe toadlet’ is a better life strategy, reduced rainfall means reduced reproduction, and so results in a ‘failure’ for toads that don’t manage to pass on their genes that year. The result is a variable life-history with the weather, something that was previously unknown. To me, that’s a great story! But the scientific paper that was written about this ‘story’ (Becker et al., 2018b) doesn’t have a narrative style, and doesn’t fit the description of a narrative that is discussed above. Instead, it follows the formula that is set out below: Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results and Discussion. This style does not treat the experiment as a complication on the way to the story’s goal. The structure introduces the rationale behind conducting the experiment, then objectively explains the findings, and lastly discusses their meaning in relation to what is already known. From this study, I can spin the story (above), because I know what the endpoint is. But this storyis just one interpretation of the correlation that was found. Correlation is not causation, and more studies would be needed to test the hypothesis concerning the underlying reasons suggested for the relationship observed. The key differences in the storytelling style from the scientific formula are the absence of a known goal at the start of the process (see a more detailed discussion of this by Yarden Katz, (2013) here). There is a role for stories when communicating science as this increases interest, facilitates understanding, and enhances memory. This is particularly true when communicating science to the public and making it more accessible, but it also applies to interactions between scientists, for example, at conferences. The presentations that tell a story and entertain are those we tend to remember. Not easy, but if we do want to communicate well with each other, then we need to learn the art of storytelling, without compromising our scientific objectivity. In addition, there are lots of lessons from storytelling that we can use within scientific papers, and to which I subscribe wholeheartedly. For example, don’t be boring, don’t bamboozle, write an active narrative (not in the passive voice), use the magic of threes, and many more. I’ve taken the deterministic interpretation of storytelling (a story with a known ending), and I’ve used this to argue why it is not a good tool for science. But it is a great tool for communication. And storytelling can be used to improve the way that we write science, and especially the way in which we communicate science. There are other fundamentals in stories that are particularly useful and should not be ignored. One notable feature of stories is that they make facts easier to understand and remember. Indeed, there is even the idea that this is why storytelling evolved in human societies. For example, most religions are based on stories that are geared to understanding of societal morals and rules. Martin Angler’s (2020) excellent book about how to turn science into stories should be consulted to give you some deeper insight into why stories are more powerful than science. Or try the exercise described by Torres and Pruim (2019). 21.3 Can storytelling help memory of science? Some argue that it can, and should be an integral part of scientific writing. In her blog post, Anna Clemens argues that stories should be used within the scientific context. I’ll let you read this for yourselves, and ask you to make up your own minds. If you like this way of thinking, you can get deeper into the depths of story thinking with Angler (2020). References Angler MW. 2020.

Citations are a means of recognising that your work is built on the work of others. They are part of the fundamental tenets of science that we don’t start from scratch each time we conduct a study. FIGURE 22.1: Google Scholar home page. Have you ever wondered what the blurb on the front of Google Scholar means? Who is standing on whose shoulders? Google and the Google logo are registered trademarks of Google LLC, used with permission. Isaac Newton (in a letter to Robert Hooke in 1675) wrote: “If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.” Although the phrase is often attributed to Isaac Newton, it turns out that it was a well accepted phrase in Newton’s time and has been traced back to the 12th century. Essentially, standing on the shoulders of giants (Figure 22.1 is a recognition that all research is built upon research that has gone before it, and this is the basis for citations in the text of scientific papers. Patrick Dunleavy (2017) argues that citations are required to meet 7 criteria with respect to academic writing. Others have suggested that there are more criteria (see Harwood, 2009), and that these are a fundamental premise of academic work. But it was not always thus. If we dwell a moment longer, we can look back at the World’s longest-running scientific journal: Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. You can download the first of those papers of 1665 and note that there are no citations (other than to books or letters) because there were no previously published articles from which to draw (Figure 22.2). However, even then, authors noted that ideas came from previous authors and we can regularly find acknowledgements that refer back to Aristotle (~350 BC). FIGURE 22.2: A page from the first volume of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. Robert Boyle An Account of a Very Odd Monstrous Calf, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. 1665 1 10; https://doi.org/10.1098/rstl.1665.0007 22.1 Research is built on existing work and ideas It would therefore be very unlikely that your idea/ideas has no basis in existing literature. If you can’t find it, the chances are that you haven’t looked in the right way. Try Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science and vary the search terms or try searching for articles citing something similar. Citations demonstrate to readers where your ideas have come from. Citations can also be used to reduce what you need to write – especially with respect to methodology. If you (or others) have already provided the methodology in full then you can give a much simpler description and the citation. Citations need to be used to back up any statements of fact that you make in your PhD chapter. Any examples need citations for where the examples came from, and when you make arguments, you add credibility to your arguments from each side by citing that these are from published works. 22.2 Your citations say a lot about you When you choose to cite one paper over another, you are making a statement about what you find credible in the literature and what you don’t. For example, if you choose to cite a poorly conducted study as the cornerstone for one of your arguments, then others may interpret that your arguments are built on shaky foundations. Experienced (often senior) readers who know the literature well will be able to judge the quality of your work not only by what you’ve written, but on what you’ve based your ideas through your citations. As we will see later on, there’s a lot to think about when deciding what to cite, and what not to cite. 22.3 Cite while you write (not afterwards) Automatically, I’d suggest that you cite whenever you write. Using citations becomes habit forming, and you’ll end up wanting to use citations everywhere. Popular scientific writings tend not to have citations, but they can still be there but subtly different. Within a manuscript for a scientific journal or in your thesis, you can expect that your introduction and discussion sections are going to be full of citations. The methodology will likely also be citation rich. By using a lot of citations in your methods, you can often save your needing to write a lot of sections which would otherwise be very detailed. Later in the book (Writing with a Formula), I explain how to start writing with an outline, then flesh out the outline with citations from your reading, and plan which citations you are going to use carefully before you start. This won’t stop you from adding more later, but this ensures that your work is built on your scholarly endeavour. I’ve seen many students try to write their text first and then only later fill in citations. I’ve had students hand in thesis chapters and manuscripts that have ‘[ref]’ written strategically at the end of many sentences. I’ve even had the experience of doing this myself when I was an early career researcher (I probably still have those manuscripts somewhere because it’s a sure way of never getting anything finished). I suggest that you do not do this. The reason is that if you write first and try to insert citations later, you are going to spend lots of time looking for the citation that fits your text. This is clearly not the right way around. Your text should be based on what’s present in the literature. I was planning to write that no-one would ever write an entire manuscript without references, and then put them all in at the end. Then I came across a video by Pat Schloss, and realised that I’m wrong (Schloss, 2018). Pat states early on (in the video) that he prefers to write first and cite later. He’s clearly a very experienced researcher and knows his literature very well. Indeed, he knows it all so well that he already knows what citations fit what statements without needing to look them up. However, later on in the video, Pat admits that even he sometimes gets it wrong, and that means that he ends up having to rewrite text when he finds the publication that he was thinking of and notes that what they actually found did not fit what he wrote. Although I can identify with what Pat is saying, I would find this re-writing far too time consuming to take this approach myself. I am familiar with most of the pertinent literature in my specialist area, but I’d rather check things before I start writing than leave it until later. I find that my memory is not only wrong about what other people have found but also about what’s in my own work. Therefore, I’d suggest that while you may aspire to write like Pat later on in your career, right now it’d be better for you to plan your writing with citations in mind, and cite while you write (not afterwards). When you submit a draft of your chapter to your advisor, they may suggest additional citations that are known to them. Don’t simply add blindly, but look them up and check their relevance to the statement concerned. They may require recrafting of the statement, or a query back to your advisor. 22.4 Citation styles There are a number of different styles, and this is likely to depend on the journal that you are writing for (see Pandey et al., 2020). The two most prevalent styles in biological sciences are often referred to as Harvard (name, year) and Vancouver1 (superscript numbers that are listed in the reference section). Most universities and journals require Harvard style. The intricacies of how exactly this will get carried out will change from institution to institution and journal to journal. You will have to find out what is relevant to you. 22.4.1 Vancouver style Vancouver style dates back to medical journals in the 1970s and refers to conventions to avoid fraud in medical sciences. You are probably familiar with it, even if you don’t know the name. It is the convention that uses small superscript numbers to denote the place of citations in the main text, and the full reference given at the end of the document is provided in order of the citations (and their numbers), instead of alphabetical order. In biological sciences, Vancouver style is not used as widely as Harvard style, but is chosen as the superscript numbers tend not to impede the flow of the text for the reader. Each style has its pros and cons. Vancouver style is more equitable and anonymous, as all cited people are represented only in the references and do not have their names plastered throughout the text. The diminutive numbers take up less space, allowing the reader and writer to concentrate more on their prose. On the other hand, if you are familiar with the literature, or you are interested in learning more about the literature, you’ll find that the little numbers take much more time to cross-reference with the list at the end, than does Harvard style. Reference strings in Vancouver style can either be separate numbers, or numbers listed as a series. Because citations are numbered in the order in which they first mentioned, citation strings later in documents often end up as a list of non-sequential numbers separated by commas. Here is an example of text (from Measey et al., 2016) with citations in Vancouver style: Amphibian populations are currently declining across the globe1-3 and alien amphibians are at least partially driving these declines through competition4, hybridization5 and introduction of novel pathogens6-9. The corresponding references in Vancouver format are in the section on references. 22.4.2 Harvard Style The standard way is to use the name and year in parentheses at the end of the statement to which the citation is relevant. Names of three or more authors are frequently reduced to ‘et al.’ (often written in italics: et al.) which is short for the Latin et alia, meaning ‘and others’. References strings in Harvard style can go on for an entire line of text or more. Some journals have rules that mean on the first mention, the citation should have all authors (up to a certain number). This can become tedious when citations start taking up more space than text. A repeat of the above example, except with Harvard style shows how much more space these same citations take up. Amphibian populations are currently declining across the globe (Wake and Vredenburg, 2008; Collins et al., 2009; Pimm et al., 2014) and alien amphibians are at least partially driving these declines through competition (Kupferberg, 1997), hybridization (Dufresnes et al., 2015) and introduction of novel pathogens (Berger et al., 1999; Daszak et al., 2003; La Marca et al., 2005; Martel et al., 2013). You can find the corresponding references in Harvard format in the references section. From here on (and throughout the book - because the book uses a form of Harvard style), I concentrate on Harvard style as this provides more freedom for how citations can differ. 22.5 Moving from Harvard to Vancouver Moving within styles is always a hassle, especially as formatting the references can take a long time, but moving between these styles is especially tricky as it may require you to re-evaluate the way in which you use the citations. Moving from Harvard to Vancouver style means that every time you would have had the year and date, you will replace this with a superscript denoting the number for that particular citation. However, Vancouver style does not allow for much variation in how you cite. You can’t use (e.g. 1,2) or (see 3 for a review). This means that when you originally wrote for a Harvard style journal, but then change the manuscript to submit it to a journal that uses Vancouver style, you’ll need to remove any explanations of citations. That doesn’t mean removing the citations themselves, but it may mean re-writing some sentences. Simply changing your reference manager to use a different referencing style will only be the start of your work. 22.6 Where within a sentence should the citation come? There are a number of different styles, and this is likely to depend on the journal that you are writing for. The standard way is to use the name and year in parentheses at the end of the statement to which the citation is relevant. The impact of all invasive amphibians is similar to that of invasive birds and mammals (Measey et al., 2016). You’ll see that sometimes the names are brought into the sentence and become the central agents of the text. Sometimes, instead of ‘et al.’ you can write ‘and colleagues’ or ‘and others’. This is something to do occasionally when you are looking to diversify some text. Don’t over do it though. Measey et al. (2016) found that the impact of invasive amphibians is comparable to that of birds and mammals. This technique is very useful when you then want to add another sentence or two about this same study. Measey et al. (2016) found that the impact of invasive amphibians is comparable to that of birds and mammals. They did this by constructing GISS scores for all individuals in all groups. Because the authors are the subjects of the first sentence, the citation becomes implicit in the second sentence. Then you don’t need to use the same citation again within the paragraph. What about page numbers? Sometimes you’ll see a citation with a colon and page number after. This really only needs to be used if you are quoting specific text on a particular page: Measey et al. (2016: 976) proposed that using GISS scores could show that “some amphibians can have devastating impacts to the environment”. 22.7 What about the order of the citations in a string? A citation string is a list of two or more citations that all assert the statement given. When you provide a string of citations, you will need to decide which one comes first. Normally, this is given in the order of precedence: the oldest citation comes first, the youngest last. However, journals have their own styles and these may dictate how citation strings are ordered. For example, they could be alphabetical. If your referencing software has a style then you can relax. Otherwise, you’ll need to look it up! 22.8 Citations in the abstract As a general rule, you should avoid ever putting citations in the abstract. There are, however, exceptions and when you do need to cite in your abstract there are specific rules about how to do this. Examples of exceptions are when you are writing about another paper, and the contents of your manuscript and abstract will not make sense unless readers are familiar with the content of that other paper. This could be because you are writing a rebuttal about the contents of another paper, or a review of the same. Again, beware of the general rule that you should not cite in abstracts. If you must cite another paper in the abstract of your paper, remember that an abstract must stand alone without any reference to any other material in the paper. This is because abstracts are published independently of the publisher, its website or any hard copy. You can get abstracts of papers on literature databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, Google scholar and Scopus. If you use a reference manager, then this will also have abstracts that are automatically pulled into the citation information for each paper. In short, many people have access to your abstract even when they don’t have access to the paper and the references cited there. This means that the abstract must exist as a standalone document so that if a citation is included, readers must be able to find that paper without having to access your reference list. This is done by providing minimum information about how to find the paper. Although this may vary from journal to journal it is essentially made of the following formula: Author: Year: Abbreviated journal name: volume: first page With this limited information, any reader of the abstract can find the referenced paper without having to consult the reference list. An example might look like this: Recent claims (Highout et al., 2023: J.Phys.Res., 34:126) that physics has a higher cause obfuscate the dependence on scientific integrity. Here, we refute this claim by showing the falacy in their argument. Whenever you feel tempted to cite in your abstract, try to follow the general rule and try to find a way that this can be avoided. 22.9 What about citations as taxonomic authorities? Taxonomists have special rules for this, and this will be explained in another chapter (see section on Scientific names and taxonomic authorities). These are not the same as regular citations (because they don’t appear in the literature cited and you don’t have to have read the descriptions), and only some journals ask for them. 22.10 Is it possible to mis-cite? Yes. One of the most common ways in which students mis-cite a paper is to use statements made in the introduction (or discussion) which were not the subject of the study. For example, in the introduction of their paper, Measey et al. (2016) make comments on amphibian decline (see above). However, it would be wrong to give a statement on amphibian decline and cite Measey et al. (2016). They did not study amphibian decline. Instead, you should read the papers that they cite (e.g. Wake &amp; Vredenburg, 2008; Collins, Crump &amp; Lovejoy III, 2009; Pimm et al., 2014), and read around those to find studies on amphibian decline that are appropriate for your context. This has been called an ‘empty citation’ (Todd et al., 2007), and underlines one important aspect of choosing citations where the statement that you make relates directly to the study carried out in the citation. Todd et al. (2007) looked at mis-citation rates in ecology, concluding that only around three quarters of papers were correctly cited. They found that 11% of citations were ambiguous, and 7% had citations that did not support the statement. Around 5% of citations were classed as empty - citing works that cite works with relevance - also known as ‘lazy author syndrome’. Another common mistake is to forget which paper has which information. You can try to make sure that you don’t do this by taking better notes or write a more accurate plan. And do the citations before or as you write, not afterwards! 22.11 Should I cite without reading the paper? No. When you are citing a study, you should be sufficiently familiar with the publication that you are endorsing the study in relation with the statement that you make (but see below). If you are not convinced by the nature of the study that you are tempted to cite, then rather don’t cite it and use another one. If you can’t get hold of the paper, this is another reason why you might not cite it. This is a regular reason given for why Open Access journals attract more citations. 22.12 What should I not cite? This does depend on the journal you are writing for. Some journals don’t permit citations to unpublished data or web sites. My suggestion would be to avoid such sources anyway (with particular exceptions – see below), unless it is really important that you include it. Other examples of texts to avoid are: text books (use the original paper instead), newspapers or magazines, blog posts, Facebook pages (or other social media sites), predatory journals (or any non-peer-reviewed article). These are all examples of grey literature. There are, of course, exceptions. When you are writing about social media sites, or newspaper coverage, you will want to cite those sources. I don’t like citations to guide-books or general text books. This has become very common, but really smacks of laziness. Most of what’s written in a guidebook has already been documented in the scientific literature, but guide-books generally don’t provide sources for the information that they provide. Thus, it’s easy to look up and find something in a guide-book but suggests (to me) that you haven’t spent enough time or effort reading the literature. Some guide-books are excellent and the authors have gone to a lot of trouble to incorporate original data and observations. But this is unusual, and most data can be found in publications. One exception to not citing websites is the IUCN Red List. Note that all entries on this site now have DOIs, and this might be a good guide for what is available to cite. The Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is very useful as it means that there is a consistent record of that version. Otherwise, you could cite any website and then the owner can go and change the site and it no longer says what you thought it did. The DOI removes this problem; there will always be an archived version with that particular DOI. You should not cite papers that have been retracted. 22.13 Do I cite the review or the primary literature? The primary literature consists of studies or experiments that are done in order to test a hypothesis. Secondary literature includes reviews, syntheses or meta-analyses. Primacy (see below) is important, but this depends on the space you have and whether the review contains all the information you need to cite. Sometimes reviews (especially meta-analyses) provide more information. It’s preferable to use primary literature, but sometimes reviews (or meta-analyses) are actually more expedient to use, especially if they are not the focus of your study. You can even cite both when relevant. Todd et al. (2007) suggested that citing review articles might occur when postgraduate students do not have access to sufficient literature because of pay-walls. 22.14 What is rule of priority and why does it matter? The rule of priority (or primacy) in the literature is that those paper/s where the authors first provide the original idea or concept, or evidence for this are the ones that are cited (Strevens, 2003). Papers that are published afterwards, are simply seen as repeating the same story as those who published first, even if the time-lines of the research itself don’t reflect this. The rule of priority makes sense, in that we have an obligation to name the shoulders on which we stand (Figures 22.1. Thus, it is important in that you should give credit to original ideas over those who copy or simply repeat them, or even those who review them. Tracing back the origins of ideas makes for interesting reading and a deeper understanding of your subject. Sometimes primacy is less important, especially if the concept is well known and/or has changed substantially. Then you should cite the most recent work that shows the ideas that you are wanting to show. Other times, primacy is more important - especially when few have built on ideas or concepts since they were put forward, or in the taxonomic literature. If in doubt, place a citation to the original study and the most recent study, then flag this using a comment for your advisor to consider. The important point here is for you to give credit where it’s due and not to overlook those who put in the hard work to publish original content. Some have argued that the rule of priority is of benefit to science as it drives competition and this spurs creativity. On the other hand, the winner-takes-all approach of being first with something drives secrecy and dishonesty, and does not genuinely reflect the team effort that is the science project (Casadevall &amp; Fang, 2012). 22.15 How many citations are enough? Some journals have a word limit, or even a limit to the number of references that they allow. Others do not, and you should probably use what is recently published as a guide to what is acceptable. For the chapter of a thesis, you should err on the upper end; from 50 to 100 references. Note that citations may well be more as you may cite a paper more than once. Obviously, everything you cite needs to be in the References (or Literature Cited) section, and you may well need to spend time deleting extra stuff. You can get around this common issue by using a citation manager like Mendeley, Zotero or EndNote. I’d always suggest that you use one of these tools as they can really help with your reading too. These days they are busy turning into a kind of scientific social network. They regularly make suggestions of what you could be reading based on what you read. This can be useful. If you are looking for multiple examples of citations for a statement that you’ve made and there are many possibilities, I’d suggest that you aim to produce three. Make sure that you use a suffix (like ‘e.g.’) to show that you are aware that these are examples of a widely reported phenomenon. You can choose these as you like, but may want to consider using what you consider to be ‘the best’ examples, and/or references that you are planning to use elsewhere in your paper/chapter. This can drive the total number of citations down considerably, and helps to keep the citations more relevant to your work. 22.16 Should I cite myself? If you are publishing relevant and appropriate papers, then there is no reason not to cite yourself. In many cases (such as with your thesis work), your own publications are likely to be more relevant to methodology and subject matter than much of the other work that is out there. However, if you’ve previously published on termite fungus and now you’re publishing on rat toes, it’s unlikely to be relevant. Choosing citations should include your comfort with being transparent. If you know when citing yourself that citing another article would be more correct in showing where an idea came from, but citing your own is more relevant to the application, then you should feel comfortable in citing both. I would avoid citing your thesis if possible, rather put it all into papers. There are times though when citing your thesis is unavoidable. Within your thesis, I would suggest that you do provide citations to different chapters as this will help the examiners see how the chapters relate to each other. Take a look at this article on self-citation. They claim that self-citations in the Natural Sciences run at 33% (van Raan, Moed &amp; van Leeuwen, 2007), which provides you with a nice idea of what is acceptable. Remember that this would include not only your citations to your articles, but all citations to your co-authors’ articles too. 22.17 Should I cite my friends? It may be easier to cite your friends if you already know their work well. You may have heard them talk and know that the subject is relevant. They may be encouraging you to cite them, but should you? In these days of scientometrics, we do need to acknowledge that citations act as a kind of currency. They count towards your H-index (Hirsch, 2005) and this can reflect on your prospects as a postdoc or employee. What’s also clear is that cited papers get cited more, so it could really help your friends if you cite them. Obviously, the inverse is also true, so beware of the politics of citing. However, the most important points have already been raised. The study must be relevant and appropriate before it gets included as a citation in your work. 22.18 Does the impact factor of the cited article matter? Papers in journals with high impact factors are more likely to be cited because their contents are already thought to be of interest to a wide range of people. Indeed, there is evidence that for identical statements published in many journals, those with higher Impact Factors are cited more (Perneger, 2010). Sometimes (but not always) the impact factor of the journal can be an indication of the quality of the study. But you should judge this for yourself when you critically read the paper. I find that the first paragraph of a paper is more likely to contain citations of higher impact journals. This is in part as these are likely to be more cross cutting (as is often the case for the first paragraph). In the end, if you need to make a choice, choose the paper that is most relevant, irrespective of impact factor. References Casadevall A, Fang FC. 2012.

The first database (from 1962), and one that continues to be one of the largest, was the Science Citation Index (now renamed Web of Science) that sought to record not only the contents of selected journals (titles, abstracts, authors and other metadata), but also the citations that each paper used. Many more literature databases have emerged over the years. Perhaps most notably PubMed contains a database of biomedical literature and has been free for public use since 1996 and is funded by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Science Citation Index was acquired by the Thompson Corporation in 1992, and this scholarly information part of the business was sold to private for-profit owners, Clarivate Analytics, in 2016. A rival literature database, Scopus was founded by publishing company Elsevier in 2004, claiming to be the largest citation database (Schotten et al., 2017). Similarly, Dimensions, was launched in 2018 as a project owned by Holtzbrinck Publishing Group, owners of Springer-Nature (Hook, Porter &amp; Herzog, 2018; Van Noorden, 2018). These initiatives of major science publishing houses are thought to be linked to their attempts to capture the scientific work-flow (Brembs et al., 2021): and see Part I.Google launched Google Scholar in 2004, and while this database is free to use, the owners are a for-profit company and the data behind the database remains frustratingly closed. In 2022, a new Open and free database, OpenAlex, successfully aggregated data from ORCID, ROR, DOAJ, Unpaywall, Pubmed, Pubmed Central and the ISSN International Centre among others (Singh Chawla, 2022; Priem, Piwowar &amp; Orr, 2022). OpenAlex is remarkable for two reasons: (1) by aggregating works from so many different Open Source databases, it has amassed 243 million works - nearly 3 times that of Scopus or Web of Science collections. (2) OpenAlex is a free index (specifically it is CC0), it is Open Source and the data is free to use. Contrast this with the other for-profit databases, and you will understand that we should support this new initiative. As a postgraduate student, you should use one or more of these databases to look for relevant literature to read. As we have seen in the last chapter, citations record the way in which people find the literature useful, and are therefore, a highly effective way of finding related and pertinent literature in your field. Before you start using a literature database, you will need to have some key literature with which you are familiar and that relates directly to your project. If you don’t have this, then check with your advisor. Sometimes, this key literature is cited in the advert for the PhD, the grant application that funded it, or if this is a topic that your advisor has already conducted some research on, then their own publications may include part of the key literature. If you are not familiar with your advisor’s (including co-advisor’s where appropriate) papers, then a great first step is to search for them on a database and read through titles and abstracts that are relevant to your research topic. Once you have a set of key literature (this might only be 5 to 10 papers), then it is time to go to the literature databases to do your search. 23.1 Searching the literature using a database There are two typical ways in which you can search for literature about your area of interest. The first is to use keywords and the second is to use citations of key references. I suggest that you use both of these tactics when doing your initial literature search. Further, I’d suggest that it’s worth your time keeping a record of what you have searched for, how and when and then download the results. This is called a systematic literature review. Using this tactic from the outset of your interactions with literature databases will give you a good idea of what proportion of the literature you are reading, and you might then be able to convert your finding into an objective literature review - making a great first introductory chapter for your thesis. 23.2 Keywords While searching for keywords sounds easy, picking the keywords that you should use is more difficult and requires a lot of practice with the databases and your key references. Remember that keywords are often not single words, but also include short phrases. Look at all of the key references and the keywords that they contain. Any keywords that they share are going to be important for you. Make a note of all relevant keywords for your searches, as ultimately, this will help you when you need to determine the keywords for your own chapters. Most literature databases have the option of using just keywords, or keywords and words in the title and abstract. I would start with the broader search term and see how well they work. However, these searches alone may return such a large amount of literature that you can’t possibly read it all. In this case, you will need to use more than a single keyword. The trick is to find the correct combination of keywords that will deliver all (or most) of your key references, while not delivering returns of thousands of papers that are not relevant to your study. Ideally, you want a search term that will deliver around one hundred papers at most, where the majority have relevance to your study area. Luckily, literature databases have some tricks for you to add to combine your keywords in ways that you can include or exclude certain topics. Struggling to define your own keywords? Help is at hand with a new workshop designed specifically to enable you to determine your own keywords specific to your study, and set up a citation alert from your favourite database (click here). 23.2.1 Boolean terms or operators There are three principle Boolean operators: AND, OR and NOT. You should use these to combine a string of keywords. They are relatively straightforward to use: Use AND when you want both terms included. For example, performance AND lizards. In this example, all papers that mention performance AND lizards in the title, abstract or keywords are returned. Use OR when you want to include either term. For example, performance AND lizards OR geckos. This example should return more literature than the previous search as it will include, all papers that mention performance AND lizards OR geckos in the title, abstract or keywords are returned. You will note that geckos are lizards, but people who write about geckos might not mention that they are lizards in the title, abstract or keywords, so you may need to use these extra search terms in order to pick up all of the relevant literature on lizards. If your research requires you to cover all lizards, then you might need a lot of search terms in the OR string in order to pick up all of the literature that covers lizard performance. Use NOT when you specifically want to exclude a keyword. Following our example above, the search term performance AND reptiles NOT snakes should give you all performance papers on lizards, but you may want to exclude turtles and crocodilians as well if they have a lot of hits. NOT is a powerful operator and needs to be used with caution, as it could exclude some relevant hits. In our example here, an item about interactions between snakes and lizards would be excluded. 23.2.2 Proximity operators and parentheses You can also use the term NEAR to indicate that two terms need to occur within a specified number of words. For example, performance NEAR/5 reptile will capture items where these terms occur within 5 words of each other, but no greater. This might be useful to exclude some papers that mention performance and reptiles in the abstract but are not about reptile performance. Once you start putting together search strings you will need to use brackets to make sure that the correct terms are grouped. For example, performance AND (lizards OR geckos) will get what we described above, whereas (performance AND lizards) OR geckos will give you all papers on lizards and performance plus all papers on geckos (not what we wanted). Explore the advanced search options of the specific database that you are using to see the correct semantics needed for a search. 23.2.3 Wildcards Most literature databases allow you to search using different wildcards. These are *, $ and ?. These can be placed at any point within a search term and help overcome differences in spelling, or families of words that you may want to capture or exclude in your search. Use * when you want to replace a set of letters at the end of a word. For example, _reptil*_ will return all terms including Reptilia, reptile and reptiles. Use ? when you want to search for any single letter at that place in a word. For example, sterili?e will capture words with sterilize and sterilise. Use $ when there is more than a single letter that might change within a word, or the omission of a letter. For example, colo$r will return both US and UK spelling, color and colour, respectively. Note that Scopus doesn’t use the $ symbol as a wildcard: for this example you can use ? instead. 23.2.4 Combining searches Lastly, there is the option of combining searches, so that you can add search strings together or keep them apart. You will need to use the advanced search options in your database to do this. You will need to carefully check your database for their precise semantics when using these Boolean operators in a search string. They are all slightly different, often using quotes around the keywords, and your search won’t work as you intend unless you are using the Boolean operators in the way the database dictates. Your specific search term may end up having a long list of terms. Remember to save this whenever you make a search, especially if you refine it during your studies. Most literature databases will provide the search string that you used together with the results. Check your search string carefully for possible spelling errors that could influence your search. 23.3 Moving items into your reference manager An invaluable way in which databases have become extremely useful is the ability to move items that you have found during your search directly into your reference manager. Beware that these regularly come with errors, and that the amount of errors is related to your database source (Scopus and WoS are much better than Google Scholar). This means that after importing the references, you will need to go back to your reference manager and edit them or they will come out incorrectly when you use them. Of particular note to biologists is the need to have all species names in italics, and you’ll need to do this yourself. 23.4 Citations In addition to using keywords, you should search citations of your key references. Typically, when you start reviewing the literature in your specific area, you will have a few key references that have been given to you by your advisor. Having read these, you will already know that they cite other works of interest, and you should follow up to look at all that seem relevant. But that’s not all, these key publications are likely to have also been cited themselves by newer papers. Tracking citations of key papers can help you keep abreast of what is happening in your field. Indeed, given the prolific ever increasing nature of scientific publications, it might be the only way to keep on top of what is happening. Some literature databases allow you to receive alerts if a paper is cited (e.g. Google Scholar), and you should set this up for all of your key citations, and perhaps for some of the most prominent authors in your field. You can’t search every paper for all the references that it cites, and its own citations. Although this would give you a solid systematic basis for your literature search, it is likely to be too much work. Getting good search terms for your keywords, and finding key references to search for citing articles is a better strategy as it makes your literature searches manageable. If you refine and save your search terms it also makes it repeatable. This will provide you with a solid basis for moving forward with your PhD, and with appropriate alerts make sure that you keep up with the latest literature in your field. The above section is a brief guide, and your library is likely to have in-depth guides on how to use the specific databases that they house. They may also provide training sessions, or online videos to watch. It is worth becoming familiar with exactly how the databases that you will use work, so this is time well spent at the beginning of your studies. 23.4.1 What else are literature databases used for? The Science Citation Index used to be published as a single volume that emerged each year and was available in the reference section of the library. By the time that I started at university as an undergraduate in the 1980s, it was several volumes large and my first task for my tutor (one Dr Dave J Thompson) was to look up all of his citations (thankfully not too many at that time). Within a couple of years, the database was digitised and available on CD, and eventually became accessible through the internet. Citations provide an idea of how the literature is used. This can be used to assess not simply the productivity of a scientist (i.e. number of publications), but their usefulness to others (i.e. number of citations). Clearly, the Science Citation Index cost some money to put together, and universities paid annually to receive the books, and then the CDs and finally to access the online versions. They were a not for profit organisation, but eventually they were bought out. 23.5 For-profit databases vs Open Source Why should we be concerned about for-profit databases? We rely on four central tenets of science: rigour, independence, transparency and reproducibility. The for-profit takeover of popular databases has meant that using them compromises the independence of our research - especially when the for-profit owners are also the owners of publishing companies. There is the potential for these large corporates to promote the content of their own journals and suppress the content of rival companies. There is also the potential for them to distort the metrics that they espouse, and evidence of this exists already. We need to be careful about the independence of our databases, in just the same way that we need to be confident with the independence of our own data. The encouraging start of an Open Source literature database, OpenAlex, should be the start to a new era in independent literature databases. 23.6 Administrators want metrics But it wasn’t just scientists that were interested in the databases of literature. Administrators became interested in the metrics that the databases produced on academics so that they could use them as a measure of performance, or potential in the case of hiring academics. The obsession with simplifying metrics by administrators who don’t understand the work that their academics produce, has driven the importance and proliferations of literature databases. However, it is widely acknowledged that the way in which journal metrics are used is unhealthy, and this has led to the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment. In the life sciences, there are three prominent databases used: Google Scholar, Web of Science and Scopus. But new players are entering the market all the time, and two of the newest are Dimensions and Microsoft Academic. 23.7 Searching by scientist’s name Once you have found a scientist who works within your field and produces influential work that you are keen to read, then you may want to search for all of their other papers to determine whether there is more literature that you might have missed. The databases make such searches easy, but you will need the (correct) spelling of your scientist’s name, and also to be aware that they may have used different iterations of their name throughout their career. 23.7.1 Overcoming the difficulties of common names While Dave Thompson could always add his middle initial to specify his work, as time went by there were more and more scientists publishing as D J Thompson. This made it more difficult for administrators and scientists alike. This has begun to be a bigger global problem, such that the databases have begun to use profiles of particular scientists that individuals can ‘own’ and curate. Each database has its own way of doing this, and it can become rather a chore so that not many scientists have their own profiles, which makes it a problem, particularly for those with common names. The ORCID number has been erected to provide a common platform for authors to curate, and now some journals and funding authorities won’t allow you to submit or apply without one. 23.8 Google Scholar, Web of Science, Dimensions, Scopus or OpenAlex? Have you ever wondered why Google Scholar (GS) scores are so inflated compared to other citation databases like Web of Science (WoS) or Scopus? I’ve always noticed that Scopus has better coverage than WoS, and that GS is bigger than both (and a lot messier with lots of weird duplicates and poorly entered stuff), but is there anything more to it than that? According to Martín-Martín et al. (2018), who analysed some 2.5 million citations, the GS score is likely to be inflated - 1.90 for GS/WoS and 1.45 for GS/Scopus. If you deviate from this with a higher score, you can give yourself a pat on the back for having work that’s reaching more people in more parts of the world. Google Scholar results reflect a more inclusive citation index (Martin-Martin et al., 2018). While WoS and Scopus aren’t exclusively English or journal publications, they are mostly. But that extra third that GS gives you allows you to show the extra scope that your work is getting outside that English journal mainstream. Is your GS score more than a third higher than your WoS or Scopus score? If yes, then your work is having a greater impact elsewhere in the world, and there’s nothing wrong with that. Perhaps GS is the better one to cite as it’s a more inclusive index: more inclusive of different document types and different languages. However, it is worth noting that of the three indices, Google Scholar seems to be the easiest to manipulate. Delgado López‐Cózar et al (2014) show how it is possible to manipulate citations and therefore metrics of individual researchers by depositing false documents into institutional repositories (note that they did this as an experiment, and you may find that restrictions on doing this at your own institution are prohibitive or lax). The authors also note that a consistent problem with Google Scholar is the lack of transparency, and therefore verification, of how the bibliometrics are calculated. This will make a difference to what papers are found, as Google Scholar tends to report those with the greatest citations first on the first page of outputs. Hence once a paper is initially boosted by manipulation, it will be more likely to be found and increasingly cited. To directly compare your citation metrics from different platforms, and also to get more unbiased metrics than these platforms provide, consider using the software Publish or Perish (Harzing, 2007). This also provides a great platform on which to harvest data from Google Scholar into a database, or put it directly into your own database, like EndNote, Zotero or Mendeley. We anticipate future studies that will elucidate how Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus differ from Dimensions and OpenAlex. We already know that larger databases should have potential for larger citation numbers. Because OpenAlex is Open Source, this means that you have the potential to build your own API to generate any metric that you are interested in completely free of charge. The prestigious French Sorbonne has been the first university to abandon their subscription to for-profit literature databases (Jack, 2023), and it will be interesting to see how OpenAlex will transform the scene of literature databases in the future.

"],["referencesoftware.html", "Chapter 24 Reference managers 24.1 Other points to consider", " Chapter 24 Reference managers Because published papers play such a fundamental role in your reading and comprehension of a subject, and citations are pivotal in chapter or paper writing, putting these elements together in a good reference manager makes a lot of sense. A reference manager is a piece of software in which you can store and view all of your papers (in pdf format or via links), make notes on them, and use them to make citations and build bibliographies. Unsurprisingly, they become something that you may well use a lot during the course of your PhD, and it is worth thinking carefully about which one you want to use. There are quite a lot of different software packages out there to help you do this (e.g. Endnote, Mendeley, Zotero - see more about these here). These packages are a mixed blessing. Firstly, most of them are not free, so unless your university subscribes to their providers you would have to pay for the privilege of using them. Next, all of the ones that I’ve ever used are very demanding and do not necessarily work well with your word processor of choice. Given all the time I have invested in reference formatting software, I think I might have been better off just copying and pasting references I have at the end of a document and then formatting them by hand. This tends to be how I do it now. Having said this, I used Zotero as the referencing software for this book. It took very little time to learn how to use, it was painless to enter (most) of the references into the database, and it is free and works with Bookdown and Google Docs. My advice here is (like software for writing your PhD) to pick the format that your references are going to be stored in carefully. For example, the BibTex format (see below) is a generic format that many of the software packages are capable of importing and exporting. Using a generic referencing format means that you will (in future) be able to change packages with minimum loss. Note that there is a difference between being able to output in BibTex and storage as BibTex files. In the case of the former, you will require a working piece of software in order to output from that format. If your software stores references as BibTex files, you are always able to take this file and use it elsewhere. An example of the way in which the generic BibTex format stores references @article{measey2017counting, title = {Counting chirps: acoustic monitoring of cryptic frogs}, volume = {54}, copyright = {© 2016 The Authors.

Monitoring using advertisement calls is ideal as choruses are undisturbed during data collection. However, methods currently employed by managers frequently rely on trained observers and/or do not provide density data on which to base trends. This study explores the utility of monitoring using acoustic spatially explicit capture–recapture (aSCR) with time of arrival (ToA) and signal strength (SS) as a quantitative monitoring technique to measure call density of a threatened but visually cryptic anuran, the Cape peninsula moss frog Arthroleptella lightfooti. The relationships between temporal and climatic variables (date, rainfall, temperature) and A. lightfooti call density at three study sites on the Cape peninsula, South Africa, were examined. Acoustic data, collected from an array of six microphones over 4 months during the winter breeding season, provided a time series of call density estimates. Model selection indicated that call density was primarily associated with seasonality fitted as a quadratic function. Call density peaked mid-breeding season. At the main study site, the lowest recorded mean call density (0·160 calls m−2 min−1) occurred in May and reached its peak mid-July (1·259 calls m−2 min−1). The sites differed in call density, but also the effective sampling area. Synthesis and applications. The monitoring technique, acoustic spatially explicit capture–recapture (aSCR), quantitatively estimates call density of calling animals without disturbing them or their environment. In addition, time of arrival (ToA) and signal strength (SS) data significantly add to the accuracy of call localization, which in turn increases precision of call density estimates without the need for specialist field staff. This technique appears ideally suited to aid the monitoring of visually cryptic, acoustically active species.}, language = {en}, number = {3}, urldate = {2021-03-28}, journal = {Journal of Applied Ecology}, author = {Measey, G.

Does your university have a licence? Do other members of your lab use this software? is there a communal repository? Can you use it to read files and make notes on them? Does it output into referencing formats that will be useful to you? Or will it allow you to make a custom output format? How much time will it take you to learn to use it? Is there good support available?

Thirty years ago, when I started to use computers as an undergraduate, the word processing standard was a piece of software called WordPerfect. Back then it seemed inconceivable that anyone would want to use anything else, or that WordPerfect could lose its grip on the market. WordPerfect became a victim of the Microsoft revolution that standardised most PC operating systems (think Windows) and software using Microsoft Office in the mid-1990s. The chances are that today your institution will still have subscriptions to Microsoft Office making it free for you to use. But given that changes in software can happen so fast and appear to change with increasing frequency, should you use Microsoft’s Word, or another piece of software to write your PhD? The simple answer is that you should use whatever you, and your advisor, feel most comfortable with. You will face a lot of challenges during your PhD including learning to write with lots of different kinds of software. Each one you learn to use will require a steep learning curve, and that will require your time. If there’s any good time to start with a new word processing package it will be before you start your PhD. If you do decide to go with a new writing package then my suggestion would be to choose open source software like (R Markdown Xie, Allaire &amp; Grolemund, 2018). More on these later. Another important consideration is whether or not your chosen word processing package will allow seamless integration with your reference manager. Your lab may have a communal repository of references, and so this may then constrain what you are comfortable using. If you feel comfortable with a word processing package with a nice GUI, like Microsoft Word, then go ahead and use it. These certainly have advantages like being able to get a synonym at the click of a mouse (Figure 18.1). My best advice is that you do not save your files in their default “.docx” format. Instead, make sure that all of your files are saved as .rtf, .txt or .html. This should make little difference to your opening and editing but will mean that all of your texts are forward compatible with other kinds of software. It will reduce your file size and reduce the chances of file corruption: i.e. when part of the file malfunctions and you lose the contents. That’s right, in addition to loss of data by back up deficiencies see Part III, you also have the risk of having corrupt files that will also mean you lose all of the contents. Even if you always use Word and never use any other file format, do yourself a favour and save each version as a .rtf or .txt file as well. Just like a back up, this means that you won’t have lost all of the text if a file goes corrupt. And yes, I do know people who have multiple backup versions of corrupt files: it’s happened to me. Keeping files in a generic (rather than software manufacturer’s) format will allow easy sharing of these files, and access to them in future. It might seem inconceivable now that anyone would not be able to read a .docx file, but in 10 years, you may be so used to the latest format that after another 5 years it becomes very difficult to retrieve information from a .docx file without paying someone to retrieve your data. The real problem with word processing packages like Microsoft Word is when files get very large as they tend to do during a PhD. Once you start putting chapters together especially if they include embedded images tables and the like you will find that many word processors start misbehaving. This can be especially frustrating in the closing phases of your PhD when you’re trying to submit it. Especially if there’s a tight deadline. However this problem is easily overcome by chunking your thesis into documents equivalent to chapters and then merging PDFs from each chapter. 25.1 Alternatives to conventional word processors Many academics are turning to LaTeX in order to write their manuscripts as this gives a lot of possibilities to insert links, formulae, references, images, etc. in a very simple way. Once you are ready to print a LaTeX document it can be shared very easily as a PDF. Be aware that the problems may come not with what you want but with how your advisor and or co-authors are comfortable. I find that commenting on a PDF takes more time than doing the same on a Word document. I don’t mind working with LaTeX but I know some advisors are very adverse to having to use this platform. Obviously, in order to get the feedback from your advisor you are going to need to use a platform that they are also comfortable with. So please consult them on what they are happy to use. You may also need to instruct them about how to make comments. For example, track changes is a function that a lot of people like to use but it doesn’t translate back into other platforms seamlessly. As with many things in this book I urge you to keep an open mind with respect to software. For example, if your lab is progressive and already experimenting with new and flexible software platforms then I suggest that you learn with them. The future of computing is certainly likely to be open-source software, and so the sooner that you become more familiar with this, the easier you will find it to adapt in future. Another consideration is how your word processing package is going to work with referencing and citations. Again, your lab may already use some software that you want to integrate with your word processor. If you are feeling adventurous, try writing in R Markdown, using RStudio as a text editor GUI (Graphical User Interface) and the Bookdown platform to publish your chapters into a single thesis file in virtually any format. There is also great support for both of these formats with free guidebooks about how to use them (Xie, 2016; Xie, Allaire &amp; Grolemund, 2018). Given that I wrote this book in R Markdown with bookdown, I feel that I should point out (albeit briefly) the advantages to this platform: Reproducibility Dynamic Content (include statistical code and graphics inside your thesis) Focus on content (not formatting) Numerous output types (including .docx, .html and .pdf) Independent reference manager (via .bib file) and style files (via .csl file) Free software and community support Importantly, what you want to try to avoid is conducting a major switch between software right at the end of your PhD. Try making such changes when you have more time. 25.2 Naming versions of files Good file management is an important aspect of a PhD. I like my students to give each chapter of their thesis a nickname or short running title that we both agree on to name the files. An example might be “Swimming_performance_V1.rtf”. The reason why I don’t like “Chapter_1.rtf” as a filename is that every student has a chapter 1, so I can’t distinguish between them. In addition, I’m not good at remembering which chapter is chapter 1 and which is chapter 2. Sometimes, towards the end of a thesis, the chapters get their orders switched around, causing even more confusion. Notice that I don’t like having spaces in filenames. This is a hangover from old days of MS-DOS, but is consistently useful today when using R and other coding software. However, some software platforms react oddly with underscore (_), and so you might need to work with a hyphen instead of a space (-). Once I’ve commented on a file and sent it back in an email, or uploaded it to their shared folder, I’ll add my initials Swimming_performance_V1_JM.rtf. Each time I comment on this version, I will add a number to my initials and the student adds one back, so eventually, we might come to: Swimming_performance_V1_JM3_MM2.rtf. After three rounds, we would normally send a clean V2 out to co-authors and once their comments are back in we should be all set. While you and your advisor can adopt any naming convention you like, you and they need to instantly be able to distinguish between a new version and one that they have already commented on by the file name. No advisor wants to spend time commenting on a chapter and then be told that it was an old version. 25.3 How many versions of each file should you keep? I would suggest keeping at least one older version of each file to minimise the possibility of losing the content through corrupt files, but you should also be keeping those .rtf or .txt files as well, just in case. Because of my early experience with file corruption, I started to keep all versions of files. This is unnecessary, and I’ve never needed to go back to anything but the last version. Nevertheless, text files take up very little space and it’s not a problem to keep more versions if you want to. More on this in the chapter on data management. References Xie Y. 2016.

"],["paywall.html", "Chapter 26 What to do when faced with a paywall?", " Chapter 26 What to do when faced with a paywall? Unless you are at one of the most prestigious institutions, you will likely encounter the paywall from time to time. This is when you cannot access the content of a paper that you want to read, but instead are asked by the publisher to pay for access. There are many legitimate options that you have to access such content. Ultimately however, you can always ask for an interlibrary loan. This is last on the list as someone will have to pay for it and it will take some time. Your library may have an allocation that they can use before the bill comes to your advisor’s desk. 26.0.1 Go to your library Unsurprisingly, this should be your first port of call. It’s probable that your library has an electronic portal that you can use to access all of their subscriptions. But don’t forget that they have stacks with old copies and you might need to physically enter the building. Try it. They are great places! 26.0.2 Look for links from Google Scholar Google Scholar has lots of links (on the right) labelled with “[pdf]”, and these are often integrated with your library. If there’s nothing at first, click on the “All 9 versions” link (below and to the right). This may reveal that there is more than one version with a pdf, and you might have access to one of the others. Check for a link to the author on google scholar, and then look for a link to their website. 26.0.3 Google the title in quotes Sometimes, Google scholar won’t show a pdf, but you can Google the title “in quotes” and get back a direct link to the pdf. Although rare, it’s worth a try before moving on. 26.0.4 Go to the author websites and look for links Authors often have official university websites, and sometimes their own home curated sites that may have pdfs of all their papers. Use the clues at your disposal, including a general search engine, and follow the trail. 26.0.5 Go to the intitutional repository of the author Most university libraries curate an institutional repository of pdfs of published final manuscripts accepted for publication, so-called Green Open Access copies. These are identical to the printed versions save for the typesetting and proof reading that is done after this accepted copy. 26.0.6 Try an Open Source OA tool There are an increasing number of Open Source tools that aim to legally find articles for you. A good example is Unpaywall which has more than 30 million articles and this OA tool is growing all the time. Another tool, OA Button works as a browser extension which will do the searching for you (i.e. most of what is above), also returning a legal OA version of the text you are looking for. These tools are a great way of getting access to OA sources, but note that it will only work if you and others label your Green OA work with the publishers’ DOI. 26.0.7 Write to the author and request a pdf Some authors will respond very quickly to reprint requests, while you won’t hear from others for sometime, or at all. However, this was the traditional way of obtaining a copy that you didn’t have access to, and is definitely worth trying. You should be able to get the email address of the corresponding author from the journal website. Sometimes these are hidden and you need to jump through hoops to find them. You could also search for the email addresses of any co-authors, and also write to them. 26.0.8 Go to an academic social media site Many academics also have accounts on academic social media sites (e.g. Academia.edu; ResearchGate.net). You will need to join the network (using an email address from an academic institution) and have your own account, but these house a lot of pdfs that you can’t get elsewhere. 26.0.9 Black open access There are sites that host papers that infringe the copyright holders’ rights, often termed Black OA sites. These sites are blocked by some institutions and are inaccessible from some countries. 26.0.10 Use your contacts at other universities The chances are that you have friends at other universities where the subscription you are looking for is not behind a paywall. If not, then ask your advisor or labmates, or post it on your lab’s (electronic) notice board. 26.0.11 Go back to your librarian and ask them for help Librarians have contacts at other libraries. Some have had careers at other institutions or have met people at conferences who’ll be prepared to help them. Librarians are great people and well worth getting to know. Their job is to help you get stuff, so it’s always worth engaging with them. 26.0.12 Get an interlibrary loan This comes last on my list as it costs money. If what you are after is a book, then you might end up going here very quickly as many older books are not available online. If it is a paper, it will likely be copied or scanned into a pdf where it occurs. If it is a physical loan, the interlibrary loan will be time limited. When filling out the form, make sure you know where the loan will be billed to before you submit it. And don’t come here first, the chances are that you can get it somewhere in the list above much faster and cheaper. Note that there are Open Source tools now available for your librarian that can make interlibrary loans much cheaper, for example InstantILL. "],["taxonomy.html", "Chapter 27 Scientific names and taxonomic authorities 27.1 Scientific names 27.2 Different codes for the nomenclature of different taxa 27.3 Other times to use italics 27.4 Common names 27.5 Should common names have capitals?", " Chapter 27 Scientific names and taxonomic authorities There are quite a few conventions that it’s worth being aware of when it comes to using names. When talking about common names, it is a bit of a quagmire as there are few standards that are followed by all journals. Scientific names can also be in great (taxonomic) flux, but at least there is definitive help. Here I will outline my interpretation of what’s what in using names. 27.1 Scientific names There is only one valid scientific name for a species. This is expressed in a binomial: two names, first the genus (with an initial capital letter) and then the species name (lower case). This name is italicised by convention (or, in some cases, underlined). Note that no other taxonomic names (e.g. Family, Order, Class, Phylum) are written with italics (although they all get capital first letters), only the genus and species are italicised. The single name is a hard rule as taxonomy can’t survive in any other way. The most recently published version is the one to use, but happily with many vertebrates (mammals, birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians) there are well curated databases to which you can refer for the latest taxonomic treatments. Also, see WoRMS for marine species. My suggestion is that you defer to these (with citation) and you won’t go far wrong. If you do this early on in your thesis, remember that you may need to update it later. 27.1.1 Consider this example: When my former student started his PhD in 2013, he worked on three species, and over time these changed so that at various points in his thesis they had a variety of names. You can see the combinations he had to contend with in Table 27.1. TABLE 27.1: Taxonomy is dynamic which means that species names change over time. The way in which genus and species names can change in only a period of 5 years. Amietophrynus rangeri Amietia angolensis Xenopus laevis Amietophrynus rangeri Amietia quecketti Xenopus laevis Sclerophrys capensis Amietia delalandii Xenopus laevis The taxonomy of two species changed such that he had to constantly revise the names in his thesis. Luckily, he could simply conduct a ‘replace all’, but it did become quite confusing. There’s a chance that they’ve changed again, so I’ve provided hyperlinks for you to check out what the current name is. The lesson is that if you want to avoid this, work on Xenopus laevis or conduct your PhD in as short a time as possible! In taxonomic papers, and certain journals with a taxonomic focus, there is an insistence that you cite the ‘taxonomic authority’ after the species name when used for the first time. This is essentially a citation in which you acknowledge the original description that accompanies the name. Let’s take the above examples again: Sclerophrys capensis Tschudi, 1838 Amietia delalandii (Duméril and Bibron, 1841) Xenopus laevis (Daudin, 1802) It might seem that there’s a mistake above, because Tschudi, 1838 isn’t in brackets. This is actually deliberate. Tschudi, 1838 isn’t in brackets because the genus name hasn’t changed since the description by Tschudi (1838) placed S. capensis in Sclerophrys in 1838. But it is clear in the table above that the genus name did change to Amietophrynus, and it was recognised under a different species name (A. rangeri). Unlikely as it may seem, the original description of the species was by Tschudi in 1838, but this was long forgotten (or ignored because the type specimen was so poorly preserved), and the species was regularly referred to as Bufo rangeri. When the genus Bufo was broken up into lots of newly named genera by Frost et al (2006), Tschudi’s description was once again disregarded (Ohler &amp; Dubois, 2016). However, in 2016 new work on the type specimen revealed that it was the same as Amietophrynus rangeri, but because Tschudi’s description was older, the taxonomy deferred to the rule of precedence. If you want to read more about it, you can look at all the changes on the amphibian taxonomic database. To clarify, the use of brackets around the taxonomic authority only happens when the species is no longer in the genus in which it was originally placed by the person who described the species. Daudin (1802) originally described Bufo laevis, and Duméril and Bibron (1841) originally described Rana delalandii. Hence you will see that both of these authors are within brackets after the names of their respective species. The generic name of a Latin binomial is often abbreviated to the first letter (e.g. X. laevis). This should only be done once it is well established in your writing what the full name is. Or, in other words, you should refer to the species in full on the first mention, and then switch to the abbreviation. Because sentences shouldn’t start with an abbreviation, you might need to relax this from time to time. You also need to treat the abstract as a stand-alone document in this respect. You might find that you have two species, which belong to different genera that share the same first letter. In this case, most authors use a different abbreviation: for example, Ap. rangeri and At. angolensis. This is exasperated when both species’ names are the same. I have seen some comments that suggest that once a generic name is abbreviated in a paper, it shouldn’t be written in full again. In my opinion, this is rather a silly idea. It is up to you (the writer) to avoid ambiguity. If there is no ambiguity, then you may write the genus and species in full to increase the readability of your piece. You should not start a sentence with an abbreviated genus. X. laevis would not be good, because your first word of the sentence is abbreviated (X. ). Xenopus laevis is a perfectly admissible way to start a sentence. Lastly, there is a convention that when referring to the generic name alone you should always mention that it is a genus. So you shouldn’t write about those Bufo that hop around the house, but instead about those members of the genus Bufo that hop around the house. 27.2 Different codes for the nomenclature of different taxa Nomenclatural codes exist to ensure stability in names. At first glance, this might seem like quite a trivial (academic) matter. But think about what happens when a particular species is named in law. That name could (in theory) be changed by some unscrupulous biologist to open up a legal loophole, or at least some ambiguity. Once you are aware what can go wrong with taxonomy and the implications that it can have on many lives, you will understand the need for stability. Happily, there are associations of very serious people who guard the stability of taxonomy through the codes. It is important to realise that there are codes governing the naming of different levels of taxa. Viruses – International Code of Virus Classification and Nomenclature Bacteria &amp; Archaea – International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes Algae, Fungi &amp; Plants – International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants Animals – International Code of Zoological Nomenclature There are many peculiarities for each taxon, and if your PhD involves taxonomy explicitly you should consult the specific code. Otherwise, it’s unlikely that you’ll need to be aware of the contents of each or any code. 27.2.1 Peculiarities of plant taxonomy Plant taxonomy is considered the taxonomic mother discipline as the work of Linneaus in 1753 was the first botanical work that consistently used Linneus’ binomial (two names: Genus species) nomenclatural system (Linnaeus, 1753) which pre-dated the more inclusive (and better known) landmark publication in 1758 (Linnaeus, 1758). Until the Botanical Code was revised in 2012, all new botanical diagnoses had to be written in Latin. In addition to the Latin binomial name (Genus and species), plants (and some other taxa) often require further descriptors or ranks that denote subspecies, varieties, subvarieties, etc. I have included a (non-exhaustive) list of these in Table 27.2, together with some examples. Unlike animal authorities, for plants, if the combination of Genus and species has changed, both the authority for the original genus placement, and the author responsible for the new combination are given after the species name (with the former in brackets see Table Table 27.2). In addition, for plants no year is given, and the name of the authority is usually abbreviated. Because Linneaus named so many plant species in his landmark publications, instead of writing out the full taxonomic authority after the species names, botanists abbreviate this to “L.”. Like Linneaus, other prolific plant taxonomists can have their names abbreviated, but plant taxonomists became so numerous that there needed to be some standardisation of names and their abbreviations. A database of these Standard Forms can be found at the International Plant Names Index database. Note that Standard Forms in plant taxonomy can include initials. TABLE 27.2: Plants often need more information than the simple Latin binomial. This table provides the required abbreviations that you will need to add in order to properly describe the rank of your plant taxa. Note that the taxonomic authority (last column) can include two names with the first in parentheses if the second changed the placement of this taxon.

Hieracium vulgatum subvar. oblongatum Sudre Form f. Prunus cerasifera f. atropurpurea Diffel Algae sometimes exist in association with other taxa (such as lichens which are an association between an algae or cyanobacteria and one or more fungi. For these associations, there is a specific code for their nomenclature: International Code of Phytosociological Nomenclature (Theurillat et al., 2021). There is also a code for cultivated plants, and if you study any kind of agronomical system, you will be familiar with not just the normal binomial name, but also a specific cultivar or variety (var.) that follows the binomial: The International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants. 27.3 Other times to use italics In general, italics are used when names are derived from Latin or Greek. A number of subdisciplines have international codes for how the names should be written: Anatomy, Histology, Embryology and Neuroanatomy. There is often confusion about these correct terms, but luckily four major publications are here to help you. These are maintained by the international groups who specialise in standardising the nomenclature, and they are republished from time to time (so look out for updates). I provide directions to these citations should your research require them: Terminologia Anatomica. (Anatomical Terminology, 1998) Terminologia Histologica. (Anatomical Terminology, 2008) Terminologia Embryologica. (Anatomical Terminology, 2013) Terminologia Neuroanatomica. (Anatomical Terminology, 2017) 27.4 Common names Common names have a different set of problems to those that we’ve seen for scientific names. These are largely focussed on: what name to use, and whether or not to capitalise the common name. What name to use - This is tricky. My suggestion would be to take the most commonly used common name, as that’s likely to be the one that most people will recognise. However, it’s not always that simple and because there’s no ‘correct’ common name, you have some leeway to choose the one you prefer. Let’s take an example: The African Clawed Frog is a very widely used name for Xenopus laevis which is used all over the world as the model amphibian. However, African Clawed Frogs is also the commonly accepted name for the entire genus, Xenopus. Thus, shouldn’t we avoid using this for the species X. laevis? So, let’s look at the alternatives. Frost (2023) lists 13 common names for this species. Names such as Platanna and Common Platanna are difficult to use in scientific papers as they are only regularly used in South Africa. Clawed Toad is not appropriate, as it is not a toad (reserved for members of the family Bufonidae), a confusion that dates right back to Daudin’s 1802 description. Clawed Frog has the same problem as African Clawed Frog, and other variants such as Upland Clawed Frog and Smooth Clawed Frog also seem inappropriate as this species is neither confined to uplands, nor the only member of the genus which is smooth (although ‘laevis’, the species name, does mean ‘smooth’). There has been a recent movement to formulate common names into genera (or even families) such that the specific common name takes on a specific epithet of the generic or familial common name. In a world of stable taxonomy (such as that enjoyed by ornithologists), I can understand that this is possible. But imagine the requirements in common name changes for frogs in Table 27.1 over only a few years. Surely the useful thing about common names is that they are used commonly by normal people who don’t worry about taxonomy? If we insist on common names constantly changing, don’t we risk alienating the public? I eventually decided to use ‘African Clawed Frog’ as this is the most widely recognised common name for this species. It does become an issue when writing about X. laevis and other Xenopus species (as we have), but we’ve managed to resolve this without too much difficulty. 27.5 Should common names have capitals? Warning: lots of people get very upset about this point and there are two views: 27.5.1 View 1 - Yes, use capitals for common names Common names are proper nouns and proper nouns start with capitals. The Western Leopard Toad is not any toad, and the African Clawed Frog isn’t any frog. The Cape platanna is any platanna living in the Cape, but the Cape Platanna is Xenopus gilli. In this last example, you can see how capitalisation reduces ambiguity and differentiates between adjectives and nouns. Personally, I find that capitalising common names helps them stand out in the text, and as a reader it helps me immediately recognise that a word is a name, and not a regular adjective. As many common names contain strings of words including adjectives, I find that I might need to re-read a section when I realise that a common name is being used, and that the author is not describing an attribute of the species. Note that many common names are hyphenated, and if this is the case then you should only capitalise the first part of two in a hyphenation: i.e. White-throated Sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis), not White-Throated Sparrow. 27.5.2 View 2 - No, don’t use capitals for common names Common names are not proper nouns (like scientific names) and so should not be capitalised. Many journals do not capitalise common names and insist on lower case unless they are proper nouns, like African in African clawed frogs. This seems to have arisen from editors who dislike superfluous capitalisation. Other reasons why capitalisation might not be implemented for common names include: They are not proper nouns, and so (according to traditional English grammar rules) should not be capitalised Countries publish style manuals for what is acceptable (e.g. see here), and these often state that common names should not be capitalised I suspect that many publishers follow these official national guidelines when making decisions about scientific journals Many publishers and their editors hate superfluous capitalisation and attempt to eliminate it. This simply comes from sloppy writers who tend to overcapitalise. The capitalisation of common names implies some sort of official recognition: that it is the common name, and not any common name. Some groups, such as ornithologists, have only one common name for each species that they officially recognise. They take this to absurd lengths when they insist that all common bird names must be capitalised while common names for other taxonomic groups must not be capitalised (see here). Even when ornithologists get their own way, and bird names get capital letters, these are changed to lower case when they are in a list with other animals and plants that carry lower-case (see here) You may notice that Wikipedia does not use capitalisation for common names (see here). They state that this is because they avoid superfluous capitalisation in English (much as editors do - see above). On balance, I’d say that it’s likely that your usage will be dictated by the policies of your faculty, advisor or journal. 27.5.3 Changing scientific names to English names There are many examples of names of scientific taxa that are changed to English derivatives of the original Latin names (see Table 27.3). While the official Latin version of the scientific name almost always carries a capital letter (see above), these anglicised versions do not. TABLE 27.3: Latin names can be changed into English versions. You may not realise it, but many English names have been derived from scientific names. While the Latin names usually carry capital letters (see above), these anglicised versions do not. Taxonomic rank Latin name English derivative Kingdom Animalia animal Phylum Arthropoda arthropod Order Carnivora carnivore Superfamily Vespoidea vespoids Family Bufonidae bufonid Subfamily Felinae feline Genus Eucalyptus eucalypt Turning a Latin taxonomic rank into an English derivative is a useful mechanism in which to bring variation into your writing. While there are distinct rules about the use of taxonomic ranks (see above), there are not with these anglicised derivatives, and you can use them as you want. Even if they haven’t been used before for your study group, there is no reason why you should not erect an English derivative for your own purposes - as long as this enhances readability and does not cause more confusion.

It was easy to believe that the authors of those papers had set great puzzles for me to try to understand their content.

As an editor, I once experienced an author who thought the opposite, and for me, this was the epiphany. The submitted manuscript was an impenetrable mess. I could tell that there was good work in there, but as an editor, I felt that the information had been made so obscure by the authors that my readers were unlikely to get much out of it. The author was a colleague, and so I decided to phone him and chat about the need for much greater clarity in his manuscript. Experience with email has taught me that they can often be taken in the wrong way; usually in the worst possible way. The response I got surprised me. The author recognised that his text was dense and was unapologetic. “Let the reader work to make sense of my data,” he said. My epiphany came not because this was a totally alien concept, but because during my PhD days, this was exactly how I had thought scientific writing should be done. I had spent so many hours slogging through dense and dreary papers by well-respected figures. The reward came when I finally understood what it was that they were trying to communicate. This felt so great that I believed the puzzle they had set me was what I should set my own readers. Happily, my advisor didn’t feel the same way, but for years I continued to believe that a paper should be a decent puzzle for readers to crack. This might seem a crazy concept, but it’s not an uncommon problem. For a great take on this in Chemistry, see this article by Murray (2011). The preponderance of impenetrable guff has led to a general perception that “academics stink at writing” - as Steven Pinker put it (Pinker, 2014). But, I think that Pinker (2014) is outdated. Certainly, as Plaxco (2010) has it, there are a lot of ways that academics can improve their writing, for each other. But the belief that all academic writing is going to be accessible to the general public is far fetched. This is because there are a lot of terms when writing journal articles that are there for precision and brevity. These terms will exclude a larger audience, especially when they get so dense that looking them up is simply too arduous. What Plaxco (2010) urges us to do is to make the rest of the text as accessible and easy as possible. Any good writing is an artform, and that includes good academic writing. You can’t expect to be the best until you’ve spent some time at it. If you consider a portfolio of your completed written work as ‘your experience’, you will get some insight into exactly how small this is, even once you’ve finished your PhD. There are still authors out there who attempt to set puzzles for their readers, but they aren’t in the mainstream any more. Instead, biological sciences have some inspiring writers, and many more are taught how to inspire future generations towards communicating great science. That’s not to say that there are no puzzles left. Much of what we do requires great puzzle-solving abilities. However, let’s keep the puzzles away from communicating with our audience, make their job as reader easy or even pleasurable, and they’ll keep coming back for more. 28.1 Develop your writing style During the course of your PhD you should improve your writing style toward proficient communication with your target audience. This will involve improving both your technical writing and accessibility writing skills. Although the bottom left portion of Figure 28.1 is labelled “Poor communication” we might more productively think of it as being the area of the ‘first draft’. You have to start somewhere. If your current style is too ‘hard’ and technical (top left), then you will need to increase your accessibility. If on the other hand you are used to a more popular writing style (bottom right), you will need to increase your technical ability. See Dunleavy (2003) for more insight on achieving your requisite writing style. FIGURE 28.1: Develop your scientific writing style. Pitching your writing style will take some practice to reach the desired pitch. Wherever your starting point in this technicality and accessibility square, your aim is to move toward the top right corner. Adapted from Dunleavy (2003: Fig. 5.1). 28.1.1 Don’t bamboozle It’s easy to use technical jargon (top left portion of Figure 28.1). The whole point of jargon is to convey an (usually complex) idea in a short amount of space. Using a word (or two) instead of using several sentences clearly has some advantages. However, there is such a thing as too much jargon. Simply put, it’s unnecessary to use jargon when you can use plain English in the same amount of space. My old advisor at Liverpool University, the late, great Brian Moss, shared the following example of too much jargon by Bump et al (Bump et al., 2009), when plain English would have been much shorter. Do yourself a favor and read the abstract of Bump et al. (2009). The fact that it gave Moss a chance to write about moose wasn’t lost on anyone (see Figure 28.2)! FIGURE 28.2: Bamboozled Moss takes on the moose. Brian was so unhappy after reading Bump et al. (2009) that he felt compelled to write a letter to the British Ecological Society Bulletin. 28.1.2 Be careful with antecedents Grammar has lots of crazy names for all of the different parts of a sentence in English. I was not lucky enough to learn all of these names and their meanings when I did my schooling, and thus when I hear people talk about grammatical errors my eyes often glaze over as I feel completely bamboozled! However, the more I read about grammar, the more I recognise that most of these terms are linked to very common mistakes that I regularly see. A great example is the clumsy use of ‘antecedents’. Essentially, an antecedent is the subject of the previous sentence. When writing in English we don’t want to have to mention the subject time and again in every sentence we are writing about it. Thus, after the topic sentence of a paragraph with a clear subject, for example, the next sentence might start: “This was placed…”, because you have already established what ‘this’ refers to. In the following sentence, the flask is the antecedent, and it is referred to using the demonstrative pronoun “This…” in the second sentence, and the personal pronoun “It…” in the third sentence: A large, metallic, thermally-insulated, vacuum flask was used to collect the residue. This was placed into an oven at 52 ºC for one hour. It was then removed and allowed to cool to room temperature. An additional steel ball of 33 g was used to aid melting. But watch what happens when your advisor points out (in a comment) that the 33 g steel ball was actually added to the contents before the flask was placed in the oven, and so you re-arrange the paragraph accordingly: A large, metallic, thermally-insulated, vacuum flask was used to collect the residue. An additional steel ball of 33 g was used to aid melting. This was placed into an oven at 52 ºC for one hour. It was then removed and allowed to cool to room temperature. You can see that the demonstrative pronoun “This…” in the third sentence is now referring to the ball, and not the flask. The reader is going to think that the ball was placed into the oven and then allowed to cool. This problem commonly comes about because sentences are moved without thinking about the way in which the antecedents were set up in the original text. The other problem that I regularly come across is when the antecedent is ambiguous, as in the following example: The experiment ended with a combination of faeces and bones that were then separated by a centrifuge at 16 000 rpm. This was weighed on a balance and the mass recorded to the nearest 0.01 g. In the above example, the antecedent is clearly the combination of faeces and bones but it is unclear whether the combined sample was weighed or if the mass of each was recorded separately. This ambiguity is often compounded in the following sentences which confuses the reader and ultimately means that they get lost when trying to follow your writing. When it is possible that there is an ambiguity, you must not use the demonstrative pronoun, but instead restate the subject: The experiment ended with a combination of faeces and bones that were then separated by a centrifuge at 16 000 rpm. The separated faecal matter was weighed on a balance and the mass recorded to the nearest 0.01 g. Problems with antecedents often come up when editing, or pruning text. Be aware of them as potential problems and look out for ambiguity when reading your own text. The combination of an antecedent followed by a demonstrative pronoun is a great way of making your writing concise, but be aware of their problems too. 28.1.3 Avoid the passive voice It’s really not surprising that we are so drawn to using the passive voice when writing science, as this is the way that schools continue to teach us. Most papers that you read that are older than 50 years will also tend to use the passive voice. Today, the majority of editors discourage the passive voice as it promotes convoluted sentences that are often difficult to follow and hard to read. One of my favourite explanations of the passive voice is by an eminent editor, who declares that the passive voice is “your enemy”. Perhaps the best way of explaining active and passive voices is to look at some examples. You can find some examples in Table 28.1. TABLE 28.1: Some examples of the Active and Passive voice. Remember that the passive voice is your enemy. Try to avoid it if at all possible in your writing. Active Passive The measurements did not depend on… The measurements were independent of … Each constraint limits… Each constraint is limiting… Moles enhance the risk of facilitation. The risk of facilitation is enhanced by moles. 28.1.4 Present to past tense? You will find it far easier to write in the present tense for most of your chapters, as this goes hand-in-hand with the active voice. The present tense is easier to write in, and is much more direct. Clearly, there are times in your chapter when the present tense is inappropriate. This happens most often in the Materials and Methods section. Here it is important to be consistent and logical when applying tenses. If you are writing about data that was collected at a specified point in the past, then you must use the past tense. You cannot switch tenses mid-sentence, and I find it easiest to read paragraphs where tense is used consistently. Using events as they occurred in time is also the most logical way to present your Materials and Methods. Whether or not you have used the tenses correctly often becomes very clear when your text is read out aloud. If you can, ask a friend to read your text aloud so that you can listen for any inconsistencies; they may spot them as they read. Alternatively, there are lots of software extensions that can read your own text to you from your word-processor. 28.2 Ultimately, think of your reader Whatever your writing style, you need to be conscious of your ultimate aim in writing: to communicate with your reader. Making your text as easy to read as possible (as Plaxco, 2010 put it) isn’t easy, but it will be rewarding. The reward you will get is having willing readers understand the message that you want to convey. This is something that will stand you in good stead no matter what career you have after your PhD.

Although there was a tradition not to use first-person pronouns when writing scientific articles, this has fallen by the wayside in recent years, because the use of I or we makes writing simpler for writers and easier to understand for readers. Use ‘I’ if you are the sole author (or in your thesis) and ‘we’ for two or more authors. You will regularly see ‘I’ or ‘we’ being used in the last paragraph of the introduction and the first paragraph of the discussion. It’s also quite common to use this in the methods section. The reason why these sections have ‘I’ or ‘we’ is quite obvious, as it allows you to place your own voice on your actions and decisions. After all, it is your aim and hypothesis for your study, so you should own it. Using first-person pronouns also allows you to be more concise, and there are some great examples given by Kurt Vonnegut (1980) where you can see what happens when you don’t use them. The first use of ‘I’ or ‘we’ at the end of the introduction is powerful. Up to that point, the reader has read four or five paragraphs of logical arguments outlining the background information that makes up the reasoning for your study. Using the first-person pronoun now makes the reader sit up as they have you communicating directly with them what you aimed to do. But that power is lost with repetition. So if you were to continuously use it throughout the methodology, the reader may get tired of reading a string of statements stating that you did this, then you did that, and so on. The power of using ‘I’ or ‘we’ is to use it sparingly to boost clarity. 29.1 Does writing ‘I’ or ‘we’ help people to understand who you are? Actually, all of your writing will do this. As long as you are using your own words (and not plagiarising), your writing is likely to be unique to you and hence recognisable as you. It never ceases to amaze me that it is possible to convey the same information in so many different ways. Your way will likely change with time and experience, but remain yours throughout your writing life. If you keep writing, people will be able to recognise your distinct style. 29.2 The Vonnegut advice Kurt Vonnegut (1980), infamous novelist, provided some advice for writers. First, he made an impassioned plea for technical writers (yes, you) to use your own writing style. The easiest way, Vonnegut argues, is to write about a subject that you care about. He’s totally correct on this, and I’m hoping that after all your research you care passionately about your subject. Next, not to ramble, but to keep your writing simple. What is most impressive about Vonnegut’s advice is that he argues from the readers’ standpoint. His parting advice: “Our audience requires us to be sympathetic and patient teachers, ever willing to simplify and clarify - whereas we would rather soar high above the crowd, singing like nightingales.” — Kurt Vonnegut (1980) Having said that you should write about subjects that you feel passionately about, this does not mean that you should write with unsubstantiated passion. For example, it makes no sense to write: “’”The threats to this spectacular species surpass any mechanism known to humankind” …unless you have substantive citations or results to back this up. Yes, it’s passionate, but that should be balanced by the need to keep what you write factual. References Vonnegut K. 1980. How to write with style. International Paper:2.

Many students have a problem in knowing where and how to get started with what seems to be a daunting prospect: writing a proposal or writing the entire thesis. I still feel that getting started quickly and efficiently with some confidence is one of your most important first steps. But once you’ve made it through your first draft, you’ll begin to find that you need to start refining your writing. That is saying what you need to say as much in less words and space. A bit like constantly rewriting your Tweets to get the same information into 140 characters (yes, it’s been increased to 280 but that’s not as concise). In an ideal world, what goes into your thesis will be of the same quality as the accepted manuscript. The reality is that the thesis is often more wordy, with the result that reviewers and/or editors will ask you to be more concise. How can you achieve this? Scott Hotaling has written a great essay with 10 top rules to help you be concise with your own writing. The essay is Open Access, and there’s no need for me to repeat Scott’s (2020) words. However, I am going to write some comments of my own on his rules. 30.1 Rule 1. Take writing seriously It is likely, that like me, you chose to do science at school instead of useful subjects such as English and/or other languages. It might have also occurred to you that it was a really bad idea not to have done more earnest work in languages now that you are expected to write like a professional. Certainly, if you did pay more attention in languages in school, you may not be suffering with the rest of us now. Personally, I never received tuition in the grammatical construction of English (you may know this already). Thus I’m left in the dark most of the time about exactly what is wrong. Instead, I simply try to rework a sentence into what I know is correct (and I often don’t achieve that). The lesson is that should you come across an opportunity to learn more about writing, do take it. Otherwise, try writing concisely in all that you do. Use writing professional emails (to your advisor, co-authors or collaborators) as an opportunity to write concise messages that communicate efficiently and precisely the aim of your message. As a PhD student, you should consider yourself a professional and these communications to colleagues will be received with more import if you can write concisely. A personal plea from me would be to ask that you don’t start your email by enquiring after the health of your recipients. The fashion to do this has turned into a surge in recent years (the pandemic notwithstanding), and the reality is that these are simply superfluous and gratuitous words. You certainly don’t expect them to write back starting with a paragraph about their health. Save this kind of correspondence for your friends and relatives, who may well appreciate you enquiring about their health. When your advisor, co-authors or collaborators become friends, you can move to a less formal style, but I’d argue that you always want to keep your email communication concise. Although we talk about writing science here, the grammatical rules of writing (in English) are fairly universal (with some local exceptions), so do practice your writing. Maybe write a letter (or long email) instead of making a call. It’ll also help you to read critically. If you are a keen reader, then you could do worse than reading some Kurt Vonnegut (1980). 30.2 Rule 2: Identify and stick to your message It’s important to avoid distracting your reader (see Part II). Your aim is to be thorough, which will mean including all relevant information, but don’t allow your writing to sideline them into taking the wrong direction. You need to stick to your narrative like a highway. The highway analogy is useful as although on a highway you will see signs to other places that you can point out to the reader, you shouldn’t turn off the highway to get to your destination. The best of highways will also be free of traffic jams (think long, complex sentences here), and toll free (no paywall). This will mean that you may need to delete some of what you’ve written, and that can be hard (especially when they are the best bits). You can always keep a file with all the best bits that you’ve never used. Maybe one day you’ll use them. Or maybe one day you’ll see that they weren’t quite as good as you thought they were. 30.3 Rule 3: Get to the point If the highway is ‘your message’ then getting to the point is the big sign that states that you’ve arrived at your destination. Some of the best papers I’ve read manage to encapsulate the whole point in the first sentence, or better still, in the title. Our formula has you getting to the main question in the last paragraph of the introduction, but you should have already ‘got to the point’ in the first paragraph - i.e. the point that is the bigger picture. 30.4 Rule 4: Keep your Methods and Results contained You can find a guide to writing your methods in Part III. This rule is about not allowing the methods to creep out of this section and into the results, or even the discussion. Similarly with the Results. There are some specific times when this is permitted (such as a post-hoc test), but generally, you shouldn’t expect to do this. 30.5 Rule 5: Do not repeat yourself (too often) Redundancy is often rife in proposals, theses and manuscripts. If you’ve produced a table with all of the results, then they don’t need to be in the text. The same with a figure, especially Figure 1 which is often a descriptive map or diagram of apparatus. Have it once, but you don’t need it twice. Copy and pasting are very easy, and a good way of suddenly producing vast quantities of text (Figure 32.1). But the repeated text is quickly recognised by the reader and appears very boring and cumbersome. This is likely to happen in the Methods and Results sections. If you find yourself deciding that you can simply cut and paste this paragraph while changing the variable names and the numbers, then you are wrong. Don’t ever do it. Also, please don’t cut and paste sections of methods from one part of your thesis to another. Just don’t do it. People also have a tendency to build the abstract by copying and pasting text from the main sections. Don’t do it. The reader will quickly see the repetitions and become bored. Similarly, the conclusion/summary section is also often copied from the lines above. If it’s not worth writing again, then it wasn’t worth writing before. Make it fresh, and keep it interesting! 30.6 Rule 6: Avoid unnecessary or inefficient “lead‐ins” This rule relates to keeping your text concise, specifically at the start of a sentence. You may be tempted to reiterate your point, but this is not always needed. I’d say that you need some practice and a critical eye to spot these kinds of errors. Having your advisor help or someone who has edited a lot of text. Scott’s got some great examples (Hotaling, 2020). 30.7 Rule 7: Use first‐person, active voice For some reason, most students avoid this at all cost. There appears to be the idea that saying ‘I’ or ‘we’ isn’t correct for scientific writing. In fact, it can be the easiest way to avoid the passive voice. There are other reasons why using the first person is helpful. 30.8 Rule 8: Remove unnecessary words This is really getting down to the nitty-gritty. It’s hard to do this yourself. It’s much easier for someone else to show you. Typically I only do this level of word-smithing for abstracts or when the imposed word limit means that you really need to remove excess words. However, Scott is correct that if you can learn to do this yourself, it will improve your writing. Personally, I like to slip in the odd ‘as well as’ instead of ‘and’, just to ring the changes. Scott would remove them, and you can see where he’d edit out other examples. Do we really have to be so hardline? I’d say that there are times when it helps. 30.9 Rule 9: Simplify your language This is always a good idea (see Figure 28.2). Making three short sentences instead of one very long one is much better. It also helps you avoid complicated grammatical clauses. A particular problem comes with using antecedents correctly. 30.10 Rule 10: Seek and embrace feedback I spend a lot of my time reading and commenting on the writing of my students. Every comment is made to improve the document. I do get mad when I find that this help is ignored without an indication why. Occasionally, my suggestions or comments are simply deleted. Certain students become very hard work when they don’t explain why they refuse to change something. Reading the work of these students quickly becomes a chore. You should have noted by now that it’s all about being flexible for your reader, and being stubborn about anything you’ve written isn’t going to work. 30.11 Rule 11: Read it yourself Here’s a rule that Scott didn’t have. Perhaps it should have been inserted higher up the list. It would help you to have your work read through by one of your colleagues before you give it to your advisor. But above all, you must be prepared to read all of your work yourself, and be prepared to work on it when you read. Edit and improve it on every read. Not just the first time you write it, but for every version. Please don’t ever expect your advisor to read something through when you can’t be bothered to read it yourself. Being concise is a great way to write well, and the abstract is a case in point. Please don’t forget to read Scott’s 10 rules as written by Scott (Hotaling, 2020). References Hotaling S. 2020.

Be aware also that biological sciences is biased in where studies take place (among a lot of other biases: Measey, 2022), and who publishes them (Martin, Blossey &amp; Ellis, 2012; Culumber et al., 2019; Nunez &amp; Amano, 2021). What we really need then are more studies from less studied parts of the world, and we need these to be researched and published by people from those countries. Why then do we insist that science be written in English? English may be one of the most difficult languages to learn to write as a foreign language because rules are so inconsistent, and the vocabulary is so large. At 171 476 words, English has an enormous vocabulary, followed closely by Russian (150 000), Spanish (93 000) and Chinese (85 568: although you should note that counting words isn’t very accurate and as for counting dictionary entries, Korean wins). I cannot defend the use of English as the language of science, but I can assert that having a universal language for communicating science is massively helpful, and makes a large swathe of the literature available to those scientists who are prepared to become proficient in a second language. However, none of this really helps you to prepare writing in English as a second language. 31.1 Do I need to write in perfect English? The best news is that the plethora of translation tools from various languages to English is getting so good that although learning how to read and write good English is always going to be useful, it is not essential. I would suggest that instead, you put your efforts into learning scientific writing style (as taught in this book and others) instead of learning the rules of English grammar. What we are interested in is being able to communicate your science to a global (mostly non-English speaking) audience. There is a world of difference between being able to write good English and being able to write scientific English, and most English speakers struggle to make this change unless they are taught. The aim of this book is to teach people how to change their style into scientific English. One of the major difficulties for non-English speaking students learning to write scientific English is that they don’t appreciate the difference between good English and scientific English. Actually, you don’t need to learn to write English, you can learn to write in the scientific version of your own language. But that must encompass the same scientific style that is being taught in this book. If you want to learn what the scientific style reads like in your own language, then I suggest making a translation of a paper in a journal that forms part of your core target reading. Then examine this translated paper using the critical reading tools you’ll find later in Part II. If you are not confident in writing in English, then write in your own language and have it translated. But you must make sure that the style used is the correct scientific style. As a reviewer, I read plenty of manuscripts submitted by people who are writing English as a second (third or more) language, or writing in their own language and having it translated. Those that have learned the scientific style generally do very well with minor issues in grammar. They will not get penalised for these minor grammatical issues, even though they could clear most of these up with a good grammar editor. Those who don’t produce manuscripts are not suffering with language as much as a failure to understand the scientific style. Specifically: Their citations are poor or incorrect Their studies often lack a hypothesis or clear aim Their arguments are poorly made or inconsistent The study approach or study design is unclear The writing is not concise The good news about all of these deficiencies is that it is possible to learn how to do these well in your own language, and that none of them really have anything to do with English, but everything to do with writing in a good scientific style. Solving these problems can be done in combination. First, take a good guide to scientific writing (like this one) and try to incorporate the lessons taught into your writing. Second is critical reading which should tell you all you need to know about how to write well. My suggestion is to do both. The book can help you to demystify the scientific style, and critical reading is a great skill to acquire and will take you forward with all you need to learn. Lastly, and perhaps most important, is to put into practice what you learn in your own writing. Don’t let having to submit in English hold you back. Move forwards in your own language and apply all of the tools you learn and then translate once you’ve finished. As time goes by and your English improves, you’ll learn that it’s really not as hard as it seems. 31.2 Message from an editor One of my ‘pet hates’ is that many non-English speaking editors seem to insist that you have your work checked by a ‘native English speaker’ (see Figure 31.1). In my experience, having advice from a ‘native English speaker’ is no guarantee to getting a well-written chapter or manuscript. I have had many native English speaking students who are not able to spot very obvious mistakes, and make many of their own. Most of the world’s scientists did not grow up speaking English. Yet, rightly or wrongly, English is the language in which science is currently written. So, if English isn’t your mother tongue, should you expect to receive help during peer review? FIGURE 31.1: The message from the editor: “your work should be checked by a native English speaker” Should you expect to receive help with your English when you submit a manuscript? Perhaps I should make it clear that English is my mother tongue, and that I have spent many hours correcting the language of colleagues for whom it wasn’t. However, most of these hours were spent when I was a postgraduate student or postdoc. I no longer think that correcting English is my role either as an editor, reviewer or as an advisor. As I’ve stated above, I did not study English, and would be the first to admit that my grasp of grammar and syntax is by no means perfect (those of you with better English will have picked this up by now!). I have read enough correct English to know when something is incorrect, but that doesn’t mean that I know how to correct it. I have spent many long hours trying to decode what others have written, and in some cases, this has involved me rewriting entire manuscripts. I still do this as a co-author, although I do remember asking one colleague to please send any further drafts in their native Spanish as it was easier to translate than it to re-write. The time component is at the crux of my reasoning why, as an editor, reviewer and advisor, I will not provide an English language service. It is time consuming and an unsatisfying experience. We all have our own voice, and correcting while maintaining other people’s voices is a painstaking task. There’s an entire profession that specialises in this (think translator). These days there are also services available from publishers to non-English authors to help them correct their English. In addition, there turns out to be research suggesting why peer review is not the best way to improve writing (Shashok, 2008). Peer review works much better at screening technical content than it does at improving the communication of that content. And this agrees with the opinions of some non-English speakers who ask for editors and reviewers to concentrate on the science, a sentiment with which I agree. No matter how you might hope that it isn’t true, a poorly written manuscript will not get a good review. If your reviewer is struggling to understand what you have written, this becomes the overall impression that they will likely pass onto the handling editor. I try to separate my difficulties with English from my review of the science. But this isn’t always possible. Frequently, a poorly written manuscript will mean that I won’t be able to understand why the research was undertaken, what was done or what it means. This is bound to impact the review negatively. The more I struggle to read, the more negative the review becomes. I see this as inevitable. What shocks me is that some senior researchers consider it to be their right to submit poorly written manuscripts and have reviewers or editors correct them (if you don’t believe me, see Statzner &amp; Resh, 2010). Worse, I’ve received manuscripts that are co-authored by people I know are native English speakers, but are full of glaring mistakes that appear never to have been checked. For me, this violates the terms that all authors have approved the final manuscript. But I’ve also got to admit that it’s not easy. There are other places where you might be better to go to get advice on writing a paper or thesis as a second (or even more!) language (see Firth, 2017). I’m full of admiration for those of you that have to do this. 31.3 Must a ‘native English speaker’ check your work? Being a native English speaker, I am not above having people complain about my English. I do get it wrong, and my English can often be improved. I’m always happy to receive help, and see it as a sign of how I can improve the clarity of a manuscript. However, I hope that my manuscripts are never so poorly written that a reviewer or editor cannot make sense of them. So it is a matter of degrees. There are many people who are not native English speakers who write far better than I do. My ‘pet hate’ is that reviewers and editors insist that a manuscript must be corrected by a ‘native English speaker’. I’ve seen so many very poorly written essays, theses and manuscripts written by native English speakers that I know that having one correct your manuscript is unlikely to be of much help, unless they themselves are good writers. Being a ‘native English speaker’ doesn’t automatically qualify you to write well, edit well or do any of the things that non-English speaking editors think that it does. That non-English speaking editors often comment that a ‘native English speaker’ should read my text, simply underlines the problem that many editors themselves are incapable of knowing whether or not something is well written. 31.4 So if not a native English speaker, who should do it? First, I would suggest that you check out the wide array of tools available online. Some may be behind paywalls, but provide you with a free trial. If the service that they offer is good, then consider subscribing so that they can help you in future. Your university may have a facility to help you with English language translations. Anyone you know who writes good English and is willing to help you. One option is the service offered by AuthorAID (http://www.authoraid.info/en/). Using AuthorAID, you can find a long-term mentor who will help you with your English. You can read more about this approach here (Freeman &amp; Robbins, 2006). Failing that, the best route will likely be to pay for help. There are many services available to help you, and many scientific publishers now promote these if you are submitting a manuscript. 31.5 But surely my native tongue can be used for something? Yes. It is essential that you use other languages to communicate your science with the wider community. Most of the world doesn’t speak English, and so there is a real need for this to be done in your language. Many journals now allow abstracts to be submitted bilingually. Obviously, the second language should have some relevance to the study itself. Even if there is nothing in the instructions to authors about submitting the abstract in another language, I’d encourage you to do it. The more we scientists are exposed to the reality that other languages exist, the more it will rub off on those that need to understand. (Read more on this blog Taşkın et al., 2020) Lastly, consider the words of Kurt Vonnegut (1982): “No matter what your first language, you should treasure it all your life. If it happens not to be standard English, and if it shows itself when you write standard English, the result is usually delightful, like a very pretty girl with one eye that is green and one that is blue.” References Culumber ZW, Anaya-Rojas JM, Booker WW, Hooks AP, Lange EC, Pluer B, Ramirez-Bullon N, Travis J. 2019.

We’re most familiar with plagiarism of writing and these days this is especially easy with the copy and paste function. Whether the source is the internet, a published (or unpublished) paper, or a translation of something written in another language, if you copy someone else’s work and paste it into your own this is blatant plagiarism. When finding that there is plagiarism, I find that most people are not even aware that they have plagiarised. I think that this is because at some point in the past they copied and pasted the work of somebody else into a document and this later became incorporated into their text without them being aware of it. If this is your style of writing, then I suggest that you move away from copy and paste mistakes as it can land you in a lot of trouble. Rather make your own notes. Plagiarism is a problem because, essentially, you are taking somebody else’s work without attributing it to them. However, blatant plagiarism is only one of several kinds of plagiarism, and it is important that you know all of the different kinds of plagiarism so that you know how to avoid it. Studies of postgraduate students have found that although all are familiar with blatant plagiarism, more subtle plagiarism is not understood by all (Shen &amp; Hu, 2021). It is really easy to avoid plagiarism. Follow these three easy steps (Table 32.1). TABLE 32.1: Three simple steps to avoid plagiarism. Follow these three simple steps to avoid plagiarism in your work. Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 Read the text written by someone else from which you want to draw inspiration from Make basic (not detailed) notes on this written work Put the original work out of sight, and using only your notes write out your own work There is one final Step 4 to the above Table 32.1, and that is whether or not to cite the work that you have just used. Citations are the topic of another chapter (see here), and you should be familiar with what constitutes a citation and what doesn’t. If you are taking an idea that is first provided in this specific text, and you are re-writing that concept, then you will need to cite the original work. If you are using someone else’s writing as an inspiration for your own work, then it may or may not require a citation, and you will need to read the chapter on citations (see here) in order to judge. Let’s try looking at an example: Example: Darwin’s survival of the fittest “It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change, that lives within the means available and works co-operatively against common threats.” ~ Charles Darwin (1859) If you want to use Darwin’s idea, then you could re-write the concept above, but then you would need to cite Darwin for this idea. As follows: My text: Darwin (1859) stressed that it is individuals that are most adaptable to change who will survive, rather than the strongest or most intelligent of the species. But let us suppose that you came across this idea not from reading the original text of Darwin (1859), but from another author who was writing about the same concept. “Darwin proposed that the capacity of organisms to produce more offspring that can be supported by the environment would lead to a struggle for existence, and individuals that are most fit for survival and reproduction would be selected through natural selection.” ~ Samuel A. Cushman (2023) If this was the text that inspired you to use the concept, you should not cite Cushman (2023) for the idea, nor should you use any of his text. Instead, I’d suggest that you go back to Darwin (1859), and take your inspiration from there. To take this to another step, I asked ChatGPT to rewrite the text of Chushman (2023). ChatGPT text: Darwin suggested that when organisms produce more offspring than their environment can sustain, it triggers a competition for survival. Through natural selection, the individuals best adapted for survival and reproduction are favored. While the text provided by ChatGPT is not wholly incorrect, there are some subtleties that are worth inspecting. For example, the term “survival of the fittest” was coined by Herbert Spencer (1882), not Charles Darwin and there is some consensus that Spencer’s (1882) use of this term was not completely aligned with that given by Darwin (Offer, 2014). It appears that Chushman (2023) linked Spencer’s term to Darwin’s (1859) concept by using the word “fit”, which is commonly the case. However, ChatGPT uses “best adapted for survival and reproduction” which is our modern definition for fitness, but not what Darwin (1859) originally wrote: “the strongest… [and] …the most intelligent”. The point here is that when you cite the original text, you should go back to this text, and seek out what the author wrote and intended, not a later citation or interpretation. Next, when you are wanting to cite an original text, you are often interested in the variables that have been investigated in that written work (see Part II). In the example of Darwin (above) this would be the variables strength and intelligence, and if your variable was reproductive fitness you would need to explain how this was derived from Darwin’s (1859) original concept. Of course, you could opt to use the original text in quotation marks and cite the text (and page) where this was from. However, this is not always appropriate, so you should get used to writing your own text about other people’s findings, concepts and ideas. The other point about the ChatGPT text is that while it does not plagiarise Darwin (1859) or Chushman (2023), we do not know if it has plagiarised other text from its input data: text from the internet which is mostly derived from original input by human authors (see chapter on AI here). Moreover, as increasing amounts of text on the internet will be derived from AI, we have no idea how skewed and misrepresentative AI generated text will become. There is more to plagiarism than meets the eye, and it is important that you have a good understanding of what plagiarism is as many postgraduate students only appear to understand the most blatant kind of plagarism when making a verbatim copy of someone else’s text (Shen &amp; Hu, 2021). 32.1 The different kinds of plagiarism It is important to know what plagiarism is, so that you know how to avoid it. While almost everyone understands that they must not use other people’s work verbatim, it is also important to know that other more subtle forms of plagiarism. 32.1.1 Blatant or verbatim plagiarism This is when you ‘copy and paste’ someone else’s work and pretend that it is your own. Note that even if you didn’t use the copy/paste functions, if you have incorporated someone else’s written work into your own text, then this is plagiarism. This includes using a translated version of work in another language. 32.1.2 Paraphrasing Some students will copy an entire sentence and then change one or two words; this is known as paraphrasing and is also plagiarism. Subtle variations on this including switching the order of the clauses in a sentence and substituting some words with synonyms. The essence of paraphrasing is that you start with the verbatim form of plagiarism, and you are then attempting to engineer some differences by remixing this content. Instead you should take the three easy steps (Table 32.1) and write it yourself. Remember that you may need a citation (see above). What follows are more subtle forms of plagiarism: 32.1.3 Failure to attribute If someone else wrote pieces of your thesis and you do not attribute their input, this is plagiarism. There are many people that could help with your writing, such as friends, lab mates, or your advisor. But if you then pass this work off as your own, it is plagiarism. With failure to attribute plagiarism, it is not as simple as stating that some text was written by your friend or lab mate. This is not an option. When you submit your PhD, you will declare that the work is your own and that you have written all of it. There is another form of failure to attribute plagiarism when you employ a third party to write your thesis for you. This process is often referred to as a “paper mill” (Measey, 2022). Even if you paid this person and they gave you permission to use the text in your thesis, it is still plagiarism. 32.1.3.1 Is it plagiarism if an AI bot writes it? I would also place the use of AI as a form of failure to attribute plagiarism. Currently, we are moving into the new territory of AI generated text. You can not use AI generated text (e.g. ChatGPT or Bard) in your PhD or in manuscripts submitted to journals as it is prohibited. Most institutions make you sign a declaration that you will never do this. You can read more on this topic in another chapter here. 32.1.3.2 Avoiding failure to attribute plagairism Avoiding failure to attribute plagiarism is just the same as avoiding blatant plagiarism (see below). Don’t copy and paste their work. Do read it, do make notes, but then put it out of sight and write your own work (see Table 32.1). 32.1.3.3 What is co-authored work makes up part of your thesis? Many theses are made up of multi-authored papers. The reason for this is that different people in the author line contribute different aspects of the paper. If you are in the situation where one of your chapters is partly written by your co-author, what should you do? The reality is that when you submit such multi-authored work as part of your thesis, you should also have an opportunity to declare who did what in the manuscript (see the CREDIT Contributor Checklist here). You should have written the original draft, including all of the text. While other members of the author line have have read and reviewed your work, they should not have written any of the sections themselves. If they did, then you should take follow the three easy steps (Table 32.1) and turn it into your own writing. 32.1.4 Autoplagiarism I would maintain that there is not really any grey area in plagiarism. So what are people talking about when they refer to a grey zone? The nominal grey zone within plagiarism comes when you copy your own text, this is sometimes referred to as ‘text-recycling’, ‘self-plagiarism’ or ‘autoplagiarism’. A new guideline from Hall et al. (2021) sets out the different types of grey plagiarism, or text recycling: 32.1.4.1 Developmental recycling Developmental recycling is when you are reusing text that you have written for example between your proposal and something you intend for publication or in an ethics application that you also want to use in your thesis. All of this sort of developmental recycling is permitted and actually encouraged. I would further encourage you to use the opportunity of recycling this text to develop it and refine it further, condensing and improving where you can. 32.1.4.2 Generative recycling Generative recycling is where you take pieces of already published text for example from the methods when it does not make sense to change the text or actually makes it more obscure to reword it in order to avoid plagiarism. In my experience this doesn’t amount to more than a few sentences describing technical settings on equipment. However this will depend strongly on your own subject area and may amount to larger chunks of text. I suggest that it is usually possible to reword most of the methods sections of papers. You should really only be generatively recycling material if you cannot avoid it: i.e. when the text becomes more obscure by your attempts to reword it. 32.1.4.3 Adaptive recycling Adaptive recycling is where you are using published text as the basis for a different type of content (e.g. a popular article online, a magazine, or op-ed). I think that this kind of text recycling is quite unnecessary because you almost certainly need to reword your text for a different audience. There maybe times such as figure legends where you need to reuse text that was already published. If you do find yourself in such a position then check with the copyright owner of the material that you are able to reuse the text that you want without legal issues. 32.1.4.4 Duplicate recycling Duplicate recycling (also known as ‘manuscript recycling’) is where large tracts of texts are essentially the same for the same message and audience. This is never likely to be sanctioned as it suggests that you are attempting to publish the same work twice. It will not be legal or ethical. Manuscript recycling is a bigger problem in other subject areas, notably economics (Geraldi, 2021), publishing issues in economics appear to need a lot more professionalism. 32.2 How to know if you have plagiarised Today there are several pieces of software that are used to scan text that’s written and available on the internet to discover plagiarism. One such example is TurnItIn. One of the outputs of TurnItIn is to highlight text that matches other text already on the internet. As almost all journals publish on the internet, TurnItIn can accurately determine if text has been copied from another article or website. I usually set TurnItIn to determine plagiarism with five or more consecutive words. Remarkably it is very difficult to come up with exactly the same words that someone else used to describe a phenomenon. Most people when they think about it feel that it wouldn’t be that surprising if they came up with exactly the same words as somebody else. When caught plagiarising most undergraduates claim that they simply read an article and then later happen to write the same words that were in the article. They categorically deny that they ever copied or pasted text from the article into their work. Try it. When you try it you will learn what plagiarism is all about. Read an article, and then try to write text that is exactly the same as that in the article without looking back at the article itself. Unless you have an eidetic memory you will fail at this task. FIGURE 32.1: It’s always tempting to copy and paste, but it is likely to lead to plagiarism. Copy (Ctrl + c) and paste (Ctrl + v) have become so easy that it is tempting to pick up portions of appropriate text directly from papers and then slot them into our own work (Figure 32.1). However, this is plagiarism and can easily be found by using software like TurnItIn. Most institutions will require checks for plagiarism on your thesis after submission, with dire consequences if your text fails. This is not to say that no 5 or more words can ever be the same as someone else’s. There are situations in which this happens. Think of addresses, quotes, certain laboratory equipment or protocols, and certainly references at the end of your paper. So there are many times when TurnItIn will come back with matching text. This is not what we’re looking for in plagiarism. 32.3 Free online plagiarism detection tools If your institution doesn’t subscribe to a plagiarism tool, then you can check your work online free using one of a number of tools available. There are advantages and disadvantages to each, so I suggest that you try them out, and see which suits your needs best. Grammerly (www.grammarly.com) Checks your work for plagiarism for free, but you need to create an account (even for the free version) and you have to pay if you want it to check your grammar. Plagiarisma (plagiarisma.net) You’ll need to create an account (to see where your copied text came from) and paste your text into a box, but you’ll get a good sense of whether or not there is plagiarism in your text. PaperRater (www.paperrater.com) No need to create an account to paste text into a box (but it didn’t recognise my content which is also on my blog and so doesn’t get top marks from me). Some nice different output with suggestions on readability and grammar. 32.4 What to do if plagiarism is detected in your work It’s remarkably easy to remove plagiarism from your work. Here’s what you do: Read the sentence that has been plagiarised several times to yourself. Make a few notes about the meaning of the text, so that you don’t need to look back at it (avoid using the same words) Move the original text away so that you cannot see it Now without looking at that sentence, write another sentence that has the same meaning. Because it’s very hard to replicate somebody else’s words without copying them, what you should find is that you’ve written a fresh unplagiarised sentence. This can now be added to your text, changed as appropriate to fit your existing text. And that should be the end of your plagiarism worries. This can be summarised into three easy steps (see Table 32.1). Here’s what not to do: Take the sentence swap out some of the words for synonyms and pass it off as your own. The sentence will still have the same structure that you copied and, essentially, this is still somebody else’s work. Moreover, TurnItIn will still recognise this as plagiarism. 32.5 How can you make sure that you never plagiarise? Quite simply, if you never cut and paste, you won’t plagiarise. It’s that easy. I understand why people copy and paste as a way to get started, or because someone else has written something so well, it’s hard to believe that you could ever write it any better. But actually, you can write it just as well, and writing it in your own words is worth so much more. Don’t forget that the penalty for plagiarism in your thesis might well be that you fail. More than that, you could lose your place at the university or even your job (Ruipérez &amp; García-Cabrero, 2016; Tatalović &amp; Jarić Dauenhauer, 2017). It still seems amazing to me when I submit a student manuscript to TurnItIn and see that it is completely free of any plagiarism. There are so many words in English, and so many different ways of putting them that you really can have your own writing style. Your writing style will be as unique to you as a fingerprint, and it will be entirely free of plagiarism. It’s something you can celebrate. 32.6 In summary - just don’t plagiarise Plagiarism is the unattributed use of other people’s work. It is not simply the copying of other people’s text verbatim. There are many forms, and you need to be aware of the extent of that which is considered to be plagiarism in order to avoid it. The simple way around plagiarism is not to copy any of your own text (self-plagiarism) or any of anybody else’s. This is, as I’ve explained above (see Table 32.1), relatively easy because as long as you use your own words, you should be plagiarism free. The temptation will always be great to go and copy the text that has been used before. But be aware that, however grey, this is plagiarism and you should not do it. References Cushman SA. 2023.

In many countries, these postgraduate courses will be compulsory and admission to the graduate school (Admission to Candidacy) will only be made after you have completed sufficient courses with grades to qualify you. These are often made up in terms of credits that you gain for each course attended and/or pass. There are normally one or two years of these postgraduate courses followed by three years of working on your thesis project. Postgraduate courses are widely acknowledged as the reason why postgraduate students attain great advancement in their studies. As proof of this, know that countries that have historically never had such courses have now introduced them. Despite all PhD students already having a wide range of skills from their undergraduate and MSc studies, the skills attained from postgraduate courses are designed to augment their knowledge base to a higher level so that they attain systematic expertise within the discipline, and understand the dynamics of the frontier. Hence, these courses should not only provide the basic skills for you to understand the methods of scientific research, but they should enable you to fast-track to the vanguard of international academic frontiers. Given that this is actually a really long time, it’s worth thinking about how you can get the most out of the courses that you choose, and how best to use this time in general. In this chapter, I will not tell you what courses to take, but try to give you some insights into how to pick the courses that you are going to get most use from, both during your PhD studies and in your life thereafter. 33.1 How to choose your courses There will be some courses that align directly to the contents of your thesis and you should do them There should be a writing course (and if not you can follow a link to my own) that you should attend as everyone needs help with writing A time management course would also be very helpful, if your university has one Look back at your short and medium term goals (see here) and consider which courses could be relevant in your future Some courses may have certification and be essential during your studies but also useful in your following career An important aim during this period is to build your network, so take note of who is teaching the courses and be cognisant how they might fit into your future network. The courses that you attend as a postgraduate may well be listed on your certification. Some courses may well endear you to certain employers, so consider your medium to long term goals (see here) Do some courses just because you are interested. Given that you have already done a lot of courses at university, you are going to need some that hold genuine interest for you. Remember that diversity is an important aspect of science, so think as widely as possible 33.1.1 Mandatory courses Universities are usually very strict about their rules, but these should also available to you and so it is well worth asking for a copy. The rules for your institution may change from year to year and so it will be important to make sure that you have the relevant version, and if possible get these from the person responsible. These rules may also include other important information regarding the examination process (see Part 1). The compulsory courses mainly refer to the participation of graduate students in academic activities, teaching practice and social practice. As the name suggests, these are mandatory for all students and so there is no need to consider any choices here. It may be incumbent on you to ensure that you have fulfilled all necessary credits for these courses. For this reason, I suggest that you are familiar with the current rules of your faculty. 33.1.2 Elective courses Although you have your mandatory courses decided for you, you also will likely have the opportunity to do some elective courses. If there are elective courses that are a close fit to your thesis topic, then clearly you should elect to take these courses. The advice here comes more for other points that you may want to consider if you have credits to make up and cannot decide what to do. Consider your timetable: You will have a timetable that you need to work to and make sure that you can physically get to a course as well as fit it in with your other mandatory and elective choices. Where does the course happen?: the courses may take place in another campus or online. This may suit you better, or prohibit you from attending. How many credits does the course carry?: You will need to make up a total amount of credits to gain admission to your postgraduate school. You might need to trade-off the time required for a course and the credits that it gives. Consider something from another faculty: If allowed in your institution, consider taking a course given in another faculty. Some might be very challenging if you have no undergraduate or MSc experience, but others could be very rewarding. Social Sciences - very useful courses might include GIS courses in geography, Social Sciences - many biological systems have important human components that can really only be solved using questionnaires Social Sciences - philosophy has some very important lessons for biologists, especially in relation to logic and hypothesis building Art - There is a lot to be said for having a creative elective. A surprisingly large part of the process of doing science is actually creative. If you can conduct a course that will stimulate the creative part of your learning, so much the better. Medicine - Homo sapiens has become an excellent model organism, and might be much better studied in the same areas that you are working in. Something enjoyable - the chances are that some of your mandatory courses are going to be less enjoyable, so it’s fair to give yourself something more enjoyable to look forward to during your week. 33.1.3 Certified courses You may find that attending and passing some postgraduate courses will provide you with a certificate. For example, you may need to attend a course on laboratory animal management and welfare. Certificates from such courses may well be advantageous to you in your career following your postgraduate studies, making such certificated courses particularly attractive. 33.1.4 Attending a postgraduate course at another institution Some universities allow their students to attend postgraduate courses at other (usually nearby and affiliated) universities. If you know of a course that it being conducted at another university, but that you would like to attend, it might be worth approaching your postgraduate teaching co-ordinator to ask them if you can go. There may also be the opportunity to conduct a postgraduate course online. Again if you know of one, or put in the time to find an appropriate one, it may be worth approaching your postgraduate teaching co-ordinator to ask if you can do it. The most important consideration is whether or not your institution is able to use marks generated at another institution in their own system to assess your postgraduate courses. Even if they don’t allow you, it’s worth talking to them about it as it may help those that come after you to find the course that they want. Or it might help stimulate to offer something similar at your institution in future. 33.2 Due diligence during courses You need to make sure that you get the most out of these courses. Your attitude toward each course will be an important aspect of how well you perform and enjoy the course. Hence, if you feel that one of your mandatory courses is a waste of time and you wish you didn’t have to do it, you will be unlikely to get much out of this course. On the other hand, if you have a positive attitude towards all of your courses (mandatory and elective) you will likely find them much more interesting and useful to your time as a postgraduate student. Looking back at being an undergraduate, you may have been focussed on grades or short-cutting work on courses, but for postgraduates this must have changed. You should understand by now that learning is a two-way process and that engaging with your teachers is a vital part of improving your understanding of a topic. Your teachers are likely to have an incredible depth of information on the topic that they are teaching you, and probing this knowledge will help to to appreciate the subject and help you garner new interest. Therefore you should engage with your teachers on these courses. Remember that building your network is an important aim for you during this time. 33.3 Building your network Courses are designed for postgraduates and usually taught by the most experienced professors. Use your time with them to increase your network. You should be using the courses to network among as many fellow postgraduate students as possible. There are likely to be people using your approaches and techniques in various other disciplines within your university, and making these connections can be very important in the future. In addition to the professors that are giving your courses, you will also learn about other academics at different institutions. While these people may be far from you, their work can be very relevant to your own. Using your time wisely on your course also involves reading work by these people. If your advisor agrees, then it may be possible for you to approach some of these top researchers to participate on your committee. 33.4 Time off from courses As you are in the biological sciences, there may be good reason why you need to go on a trip and not attend part of a course. For example, your advisor may ask you to participate in lab fieldwork that is relevant to your project. You may want to attend a conference to present the results of your MSc work. You may have any number of private or professional reasons why you need to miss lectures or parts of your course. Inform the course co-ordinator. Your institution may have a system where you require to be signed out of the class. Make sure that the course co-ordinator knows, and the lecturer of the missed classes (if this is a different person). Catch up. Be diligent and catch up with all of the missed course work. Try to miss as little as possible. Taking your courses seriously means missing as little as possible. 33.5 Make the most out of learning I you haven’t already worked this out for yourself, learning is a real gift and the postgraduate courses you are offered at universities are probably the ultimate in their level of sophistication and knowledge transfer. Remember that your attitude is key in this process, so be sure that you are mentally prepared to having a positive attitude to all of your courses. Take this opportunity seriously and you should find it extremely rewarding.

It could be that the academic phrasebank is just what you’re looking for. When reading papers, I often come across the same phrases time and again. They seem so well honed to the situation that I’m envious about how the writer dreamt them up. Using them isn’t quite plagiarism, but then they don’t regularly fit the exact situation that I’m looking for. Imagine cutting and pasting these phrases into a file, or even better a database that’s ready for any eventuality. Banking them over time so that they are always available. Then imagine that you did this and made it available to everyone… http://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/ Well, John Morley has already done it, and he’s made it available to everyone. The academic phrasebank is a fantastic resource: the academic phrasebank 34.1 How to find the phrase that you need: Look across the top for different sections of text that you are currently writing. Then look down the left-hand side to see the type of language function that you need. Click on something that looks applicable and watch the database open up. 34.2 Getting started It strikes me that this is going to be a fantastic resource for those of you who are not writing in English as your home language. And for those of you who just need a few words to get started. It’ll also be useful when you are wanting to wordsmith your introduction or abstract. Is it plagiarism? The preceding chapter is all about not copying and pasting, am I now telling you that it’s ok to copy and paste? Most of these phrases are less than five words or you will find that they are non-consecutive parts of a sentence. I don’t think that most of these would constitute plagiarism if you pasted them into your document. However, I would suggest that you spend some time refining what you’ve written and that when you do that, some of these phrases may then come out. "],["concept.html", "Chapter 35 Creating a conceptual framework of your PhD thesis 35.1 Planning your thesis as a concept and a practical timeline 35.2 Your thesis timeline", " Chapter 35 Creating a conceptual framework of your PhD thesis Explaining your PhD is going to be a constant throughout the duration, and beyond. Getting that explanation correct, and being able to do it for audiences at different levels will be really critical from the outset. The best way that you can do this is to get the conceptual framework for your thesis straight in your own mind as soon as you can. Once completed, your PhD will have an audience of examiners, but eventually you’ll get to publish all the chapters of your PhD to an audience of scientists and potentially a much greater audience of people around the world. In each case, if you can contextualise your work and how it fits into your thesis, it will help increase your confidence. 35.1 Planning your thesis as a concept and a practical timeline An important phase at the outset of your PhD project is to plan the chapters that are going to be in it. Think about the contents of your PhD and commit as many thoughts and ideas as you can to paper. If you aren’t sure how to get started, then think about how to answer the following questions: What questions are you going to ask? What is your study system? How will you collect your data? What are the most important variables that you will measure? What techniques will you use? Do you have hypotheses, or do you have another approach? All these ideas (and more) are going to be swirling around your mind at the beginning of your PhD and you’re going to need to commit them to paper, and doing this right now at the start is the best time. If you haven’t done so already, write them all down. If you can do a mind map or some kind of graphical representation, this will be good for you if it suits the way that your mind works. Otherwise, you can use a series of lists and bullet points, if that is more your style. The important point here is be able to move from a jumble of ideas and thoughts into a formal plan for your thesis. A thesis typically has five data chapters that are presented in a linear fashion (book format), bookended by an introduction and conclusion. At the heart of each chapter is going to be a hypothesis, a question or a technique that the following chapters implement in order to get their results. It may help you to use distinct colours and short titles (just a couple of words) for each chapter so that you can efficiently communicate them to your advisor, and use them as file names for the sections (don’t use “Chapter 1” as your chapter name!). You should then use these same colours and short titles in your thesis timeline (Gandt diagram) used in your proposal. Once you have some rough ideas for your thesis plan, discuss it with your advisor and get their opinion. Then map it out on a piece of paper. But, be warned, it probably won’t be anything simple or linear - it’s likely to be more complex that the one illustrated in Figure 35.1. It should have a lot of links and arrows that join all of the chapters to each other in different ways. It may help to code these links so that it’s clear what they represent. For example, you may want to use one colour for data and another for techniques and results. Although the detail is important, remember that the conceptual thesis plan is supposed to give an overview of the way in which the thesis works. This means that you might need to remove some of the minutiae in order to provide a clearer overall picture that others can easily follow. FIGURE 35.1: A conceptual thesis plan will be placed in the introduction to your thesis. In this (fictional) example, I show how how the different chapters are linked by a single technique (developed as a chapter of the thesis: grey arrows), and data that results from each of the chapters (blue arrows). 35.1.1 Dependencies Make sure that your conceptual thesis diagram makes clear exactly where and how chapters depend on each other to provide data, the outcome of results and/or the successful development and implementation of techniques. These dependencies must be very clear to you and your advisor at the outset so that you are able to make contingency plans in case any of these don’t work out in the way that you think that they will. 35.1.2 Your thesis must add up to more than the sum of its parts You can’t just have a thesis that consists of five manuscripts bound together. Your PhD must be something greater, and you will need to be very clear about how it does this from the start. Indeed, this is a key requirement in the rubric of most universities for you to pass your PhD examination. To do this, the thesis is definitely going to have the kind of interconnectedness shown in Figure 35.1 from the outset. 35.1.3 Using your conceptual thesis plan Once you’ve got your conceptual thesis plan, and both you and your adviser agree on it, keep it. It’s going to be a figure in the introduction of your thesis (like Figure 35.1). You are also going to be able to use this conceptual plan as a reference guide for your own explanation to yourself, and anyone else that you propose your thesis to. If you have a thesis committee, this may well be a diagram that you use in every meeting to remind them of what your thesis is about and how it fits together. As you progress along the course of your thesis timeline, you will be able to demonstrate what has been done. It may also be useful if you need to raise funds for your work, and to anyone who needs to understand your entire thesis such as an ethics committee. Perhaps the most important need for your conceptual thesis plan will be to explain to you PhD examiners, the layout of your PhD and how the chapters relate to each other. 35.1.4 Evolving your thesis concept plan Don’t be afraid of making changes to your plan during the course of your thesis. If you need to rely on one of your contingency plans, it is likely that you will have to change the layout of your timeline as well as your conceptual plan. This is normal in the course of any PhD thesis. 35.2 Your thesis timeline Whether or not you are used to managing your own time, you are going to need to learn how to plan your time during your PhD. This is not only because you will need to know what you must do on a month to month basis, but more that you will need to plan what you need (materials, chemicals, equipment, etc.) and when you will need it. If you plan to do a lot of fieldwork, then you may also need other people to help you with this. Thus you will need to know when to train and organise this group. 35.2.1 Producing a Gantt chart The timeline of your thesis will be an important guide throughout the 3+ years that you are conducting your PhD. This means that it is worth getting this onto the record as soon as you are able. One of the standard ways of doing this is to produce a Gantt chart. This takes each of the chapters along the entire timeline of your PhD and shows when you will work on each one. It may be that you want to break down each of these chapters into sub areas such as literature review, data collection, data analysis, write-up. Remember that planning your time is empowering and something that you should be considering not only during your PhD (short-term), but also mid-term and long-term (see Part I). To achieve your goals, you need to (a) know what they are, and (b) actively pursue them. Below you will find a very simple version of a Gantt chart (Figure 35.2) that I put together for a fictional PhD. Note how the colours used for each chapter are the same as the thesis concept diagram (Figure 35.1). It’s always useful to follow such colour conventions once you’ve started them. Maintaining consistency throughout your thesis will help you when you explain it to others, such as during your proposal or whenever you present to your thesis committee. FIGURE 35.2: A Gantt chart used to help thesis plan how you will use your time during your PhD. In this (fictional) example, I show how how the different chapters (Q1, T1, Q3, Q4, Q5) will take up different time during the three years of a PhD. Each year (1 to 3) is divided into four quarters (Q1 to Q4). This example is set out to show the need for seasonal sampling (in the second quarter of each year). Stars represent goals that you have set. As you’re doing your thesis in the biological sciences, you’re much more likely to have some kind of seasonal quotient that constrains the work that you’re doing. So in Figure 35.2 I’ve used the second quarter of each year as the key field period that is needed for all of the chapters. You will note that as soon as you build in a seasonal aspect to your timeline, your life will get much more complicated, especially if you have more than one chapter that depends on the results from a field season. This should help you know when you need to plan each field campaign well in advance of actually going to do it. 35.2.2 Set yourself goals It’s really useful to set down goals that you want to achieve on the Gantt chart plan, and to share these with your advisor. Milestones in your PhD are really useful when planning, and psychologically enhance your ability to finish different components. Note that none of the goals occur in the same quarter as any other goal. This is important as it enables you to know where to concentrate your time and when. Note also that the goals don’t occur in the same order as the chapters. Part of this is the need to be realistic about what you need to achieve and the time that it will take to do this. 35.2.3 Map on significant events If you plan to attend workshops or conferences during your PhD (or even plan to organise these yourself), you should plan such significant events onto your timeline. For example, If you are presenting the results of your first chapter at a conference, you need to make sure that you have the necessary results well in advance of needing to write the abstract. In Figure 35.2, the first conference is in the third quarter of the second year and you should have already achieved your main goal for this chapter well in advance to write the abstract. You might also be able to add in the results of the second year’s seasonal field work to present at the conference. Similarly, for the second conference, you should have all the results from the third chapter well in advance to write the abstract. 35.2.4 Contingency planning If you can, it’s a good idea to build in some contingency planning during this planning stage so that you know where you have options, and especially if your thesis relies on weather or having a particular set of results to continue. In Figure 35.2 I have shown how a contingency might be mapped onto Chapters Q1, Q3 and Q4 with the potential addition of another field season in the second quarter of the third year in case one of the previous field seasons fails. 35.2.5 Dynamic timeline As your thesis progresses, so too might you need to change your timeline to reflect changes in its implementation. Make sure that your advisor (and possibly your thesis committee) is aware of any significant changes to your timeline. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 36 What is needed for your research proposal? 36.1 Structure 36.2 Proposal introduction 36.3 Methods and Materials 36.4 Hypothetical Results 36.5 Thesis timeline 36.6 Your proposal - what is it good for?", " Chapter 36 What is needed for your research proposal? In my institution, you need to have your PhD or MSc approved by a group of 3 independent staff members (i.e. not including advisors) in your department. The department requires that your written proposal is publicly available to everyone in the department to look at prior to the oral presentation of your proposal. This is not unique to my university, many institutions require that you formally propose the work that you plan to do in a PhD. They may all have very different requirements. It is well worth checking out what your institution requires and by when. Talk to your advisor about this. Your proposal is a collection of documents, where each document is a chapter of the thesis. Ideally, these should be bounded by an introduction, which gives the bigger picture of how the thesis is placed, and a time-line at the end that demonstrates how you can complete the thesis within the two or three years for your MSc or PhD, respectively. 36.1 Structure Your final thesis will be a set of papers (data chapters sandwiched between an introduction and discussion), and so prepare the proposal in the same way. That is, you will normally have two (MSc) or five (PhD) data chapters. In the proposal, each chapter will consist of three parts. 36.2 Proposal introduction I’m not going to go into what’s inside the introduction here, as it’s already been done in other chapters on formulaic writing (see later in this part) and specifically about the introduction (see part 3). Although you may feel that there’s no point putting a lot of effort into this introduction it serves as a literature review for your upcoming PhD study, and is well worth the time and effort. A key part of the introduction will be your conceptual framework that will explain how your thesis chapters fit together, and crucially, add up to more than a sum of their parts. 36.3 Methods and Materials What’s in the Methods and Materials section is also covered here. Essentially you need to: Introduce important aspects of your study organism and/or study site Describe exactly how you’ll set up your experiment and/or collect your samples You must explicitly state how each of the variables (introduced in the introduction) is collected (If necessary) Describe how you’ll turn your collected data into the variables needed for your analyses Data analyses (how you’ll test your hypotheses). This should include a description of the statistical or analytical techniques. It’s useful to structure this section by each of the questions/hypotheses that you are posing 36.4 Hypothetical Results It’s a very useful exercise to imagine how results will show that you have (or have not) accepted your hypothesis. You can’t show results that would cover every eventuality, but give some typical scenarios that you think may happen if you accept and reject each hypothesis. This could be a bar chart, a map, a scatter-graph, etc. 36.5 Thesis timeline You should be able to state from the outset when you are going to find the time to fit in all of the components of your thesis. Being able to plan when and how you will do the work is a key aspect of your proposal. I discuss how to construct a timeline in the form of a Gendt diagram in another chapter (see Part II). 36.6 Your proposal - what is it good for? Once you’re done with your proposal, you might feel that you’ve done an awful lot of work without having added anything towards achieving your PhD or MSc. However, it’s actually a really useful document that you can use in a number of ways: 36.6.1 Copy and paste directly into your thesis One PhD student estimated that she pasted 60-70% of her proposal text directly into her thesis. This included nearly all of the methods and materials section verbatim. Note that this is not plagiarism, but developmental recycling. 36.6.2 Use it to raise money to do your studies. Writing grant proposals is essentially the same as your thesis proposal, and so you can use this document (with some modifications to tailor it to the grant objectives) to raise money for your work. 36.6.3 Deposit the proposal to conform to Design and Analysis Transparency This is the subject of another chapter (see part 3). "],["proposal-presentation.html", "Chapter 37 Making a presentation from your chapter, paper or proposal 37.1 So where do you start? 37.2 Know your story first, and then make your presentation 37.3 Slide layout 37.4 Practice, practice, practice", " Chapter 37 Making a presentation from your chapter, paper or proposal In theory, it couldn’t be easier to take your written work, be it a research proposal, paper or chapter, and turn it into a presentation. Many people find presenting ideas easier than writing about them, as writing is inherently difficult. On the other hand, standing up in front of a room of strangers, or worse those you know, is also a bewildering task. In this section, the aim is to break down the task of making a presentation into a number of smaller steps so that you can tackle each one in turn and make sure that you are ready. Give yourself plenty of time to prepare Although your presentation might be weeks away, you are going to need ~4 weeks to get the presentation ready, run it past your advisor (and potentially other co-authors), and practice your talk. As usual, my advice is not to leave it until the last minute to prepare as you’ll get out what you put in. Know who your audience is and what they expect If you have no idea of who your audience will be and what they will be expecting, then attend some other talks in the same seminar series, or ask your advisor and/or other lab colleagues for input. The more cross-disciplinary your audience is, the more general you should make your talk. If you’ve still no idea, pitch it for a very broad audience at last year undergraduate level. Be sure of exactly how much time you will have to talk Be aware that your time slot might include time for questions, and so find out exactly how much talking time you have. If there is a long time set aside for discussion, you might want to throw some extra slides in that can help facilitate answering expected questions. Make sure you know the format of the presentation If you don’t know, then you can’t make any assumptions about what might be present in the room where you give your presentation. I turned up to give my talk with a presentation on a USB drive only to find that there was no computer, no projector and a room of people expecting me to entertain them for an hour. Even if you know that a projector is present, it’s good to have some extra context: for example is the computer Mac, PC or Linux; should you bring your own laptop; is there a pointer; can it advance slides if in doubt, then bring your own accessories. Know exactly where you are giving your talk and plan for plenty of travel time Hopefully, you will be very familiar with the venue, and travelling to the venue will only involve a brief walk. I’ve made some rookie errors in the past, including deciding to cycle to the venue, getting caught in a cloudburst and arriving literally dripping wet (it was in the UK). The more comfortable you are with the whole setup, and the more organised you can be about getting yourself there without incidents, the better the talk will go for you. Essentially, you have a story to tell, but that does not mean you are story telling. It means that your presentation will require you to talk continuously for your allotted period of time, and that the sentences must follow on from each other in a logical narrative; i.e. a story. 37.1 So where do you start? 37.1.1 Here are some simple rules to help guide you to build your presentation: One slide per minute: However many minutes you have to present, that’s your total number of slides. Don’t be tempted to slip in more. Keep the format clear: There are lots of templates available to use, but you’d do best to keep your presentation very clean and simple. Be careful with animations: You can build your slide with animations (by adding images, words or graphics). But do not flash, bounce, rotate or roll. No animated little clipart characters. No goofy cartoons – they’ll be too small for the audience to read. No sounds (unless you are talking about sounds). Your audience has seen it all before, and that’s not what they’ve come for. They have come to hear about your research proposal. **Don’t be a comedian*: Everyone appreciates that occasional light-hearted comment, but it is not stand-up. If you feel that you must make a joke, make only one and be ready to push on when no-one reacts. Sarcasm simply won’t be understood by the majority of your audience, so don’t bother: unless you’re a witless Brit who can’t string three or more sentences together without [in which case you have my empathy]. 37.1.2 A formula for presenting a proposal You need a title slide (with your name, that of your advisor and institution) Several slides of introduction that put your study into the big picture explain variables in the context of existing literature explain the relevance of your study organisms give the context of your own study provide your conceptual framework for your thesis Your aims and hypotheses Methods and Materials Images of apparatus or diagrams of how apparatus are supposed to work. If you can’t find anything, draw it simply yourself. Your methods can be abbreviated but the methods are important for a proposal, especially the numbers of replicates and the variables that you plan to measure from them. Analyses are important. Make sure that you understand how they work, otherwise, you won’t be able to present them to others. Importantly, explain where each of the variables that you introduced, and explained how to measure, fit into the analyses. There shouldn’t be anything new or unexpected that pops up here. Expected results 6 like to see what the results might look like, even if you have to draw graphs with your own lines on it. Use arrows to show predictions under different assumptions. Budget Show your timeline 37.2 Know your story first, and then make your presentation Despite previous sections of this book cautioning you against storytelling, you really need to have turn your study into a story in order to present it well. This means that you know what the message you want to reveal to the audience is. When you develop your story, be imaginative and creative. There are plenty of different styles to telling stories, and you should feel free to borrow styles that best fit your scenario. For example, you can reveal the punch line right at the beginning, and then work back through the presentation to show how you arrive there (but always try to keep something to reveal on the way there). Props are also excellent to produce in talks, something that you can bring with you, and show to an audience, that reveals more about your study. You want your audience to understand your story, but you also want them to remember it. Anything that will help them remember is likely to be a good prop. In order to keep your audience with you, you need to produce reminders throughout the presentation. This could be themed images or colours that correspond to particular concepts, questions or ideas. If you get confused and can’t work out how to present all of the information, then the chances are that your audience won’t be able to keep track either. Slim down your study to something that will be easier to put to a story. Just like a real story, some things can’t be left out, like characters (i.e. variables) that you rely on to answer your questions. Don’t take time to talk about anything off the prepared storyline, as you’ll likely lose the audience or confuse them. Treat your main variables like characters that appear with some regularity and consist characteristics throughout the story. Remember that you don’t need to include every detail in your slides or your talk. If the audience can follow your story, but wants to know the details at the end, then they can ask questions about the details. Indeed, you can tell your audience precisely this as a way of side-stepping chunks of (especially boring) methodologies. The audience is there to listen to you tell your story, and your slides (if you decide to use them), should be props that help you tell your story. Talk and interact with the audience to tell your story. Point to the slides to help you illustrate the points that you can’t otherwise make, or to underline important points in your story. Above all, you need to make sure that the audience is listening to you tell your story. Fewer words are better. Tell the story yourself using the props on the slide 37.3 Slide layout Your aim is to have your audience listen to you, and only look at the slides when you indicate their relevance. You’d be better off having slides without words, then your audience will listen instead of trying to read. As long as they are reading, they aren’t listening. Really try to limit the words you have on any single slide (&lt;30). Don’t have full sentences, but write just enough to remind you of what to say and so that your audience can follow when you are moving from point to point. Use bullet pointed lists if you have several points to make (Font 28 pt) If you only have words on a slide, then add a picture that will help illustrate your point. This is especially useful to illustrate your organism. At the same time, don’t have anything on a slide that has no meaning or relevance. Make sure that any illustration is large enough for your audience to see and understand what it is that you are trying to show. Everything on your slide must be mentioned in your presentation, so remove anything that becomes irrelevant to your story when you practice. Tables: you are unlikely to have large complex tables in a presentation as presenting raw data or small words in a table is a way to lose your audience. Make your point in another way. Use citations (these can go in a smaller font: 20 pt). I like to cut out the title and authors of the paper from the pdf and show it on the slide. If you can, have some banner that states where you are in your presentation (e.g. Methods, or 5 of 13). It helps members of the audience who might have been daydreaming. Large font, symbols that are consistent, familiar themes and photos all make for a good slide 37.4 Practice, practice, practice It can’t be said enough that you must practice your presentation. Do it in front of a mirror in your bathroom, or in front of your friends. It’s the best way of making sure you’ll do a good job. If you can’t remember what you need to say, write flash cards with prompts. Include the text on your slide and expand. When you learn what’s on the cards, relate it to what’s on the slide so that you can look at the slides and get enough hints on what to say. Don’t bring flashcards with you to your talk. Instead be confident enough that you know them front to back and back to front. Practice with a pointer and slide advancer (or whatever you will use in the presentation). You should be pointing out to your audience what you have on your slides; use the pointer to do this. Avoid taking anything with you that you might fiddle with. "],["transparency.html", "Chapter 38 Starting out transparent 38.1 Preregistration 38.2 Transparency as you move forwards", " Chapter 38 Starting out transparent The scientific method requires us to pose a falsifiable hypothesis, design a controlled, rigorous and repeatable methodology, and report and interpret our results honestly. In theory, it’s all pretty straight forward. I’d like to think that in a world where science is adequately funded, we’d have already reached a situation where transparency was endemic in the scientific system. However, science has not been so lucky, and where there are shortcuts, some people will take them in order to get ahead of others. One of the objectives of this book is to demystify what happens in biological sciences. In other words, the demystification in this book is only really needed because so much of what happens does so behind closed doors, and out of the gaze of less privileged scientists. As you read through this book, you will see countless examples of where things are not as they should be. I have always tried to insert solutions when I highlight problems, but these are admittedly piecemeal, rarely proven, and even in a best case scenario might be best thought of as temporary solutions. The logical antidote to all these shady scientific dealings is to turn to transparency. We would do better moving to open and transparent science. The open science movement is gaining traction (Sullivan, DeHaven &amp; Mellor, 2019), and I hope that it will become the norm in the very near future. Those of you who are reading this now are likely to be students during an interim period prior to open science becoming mainstream. Therefore, you will be instrumental in adopting this process as soon as possible to ensure that science becomes a fairer place for scientists from all backgrounds, and with all results. The idea is that this will impact research all the way from planning to publishing in a set of Top Factors, which are likely to be increasingly adopted by funders (see here). In this book, I consistently encourage you toward transparent and open practices in science. Here my aim is to introduce this topic and provide an overview of the main areas in which you can currently make a difference by opening up your research. As the Centre for Open Science explains (COS: see here), this will take a shift in the culture of the scientific community, which is why you need to understand and adopt a transparent approach from the outset of your research career. There are much better and more comprehensive guides and online resources, so I encourage you to look through the literature cited here. Although I advocate hard for the COS, please be aware that this is not the only set of guidelines (see also recent moves by the Public Library of Science and Peer Community In). 38.1 Preregistration You will spend a considerable amount of time at the beginning of your PhD studies planning what you want to do. In many institutions, this will take the form of a formal proposal. It will be agreed with your advisor, and may well pass the inspection of a committee. You will put a lot of effort into reading the literature in order to ask the best hypotheses possible. You will design your experiments with rigor and control, and potentially redesign them after your advisor and committee comment. The effort put into your proposal is totally disproportionate if it’s never looked at again. Yet, this document is of historical importance because it says what you think before ever doing the experiment, and collecting or analysing the data. Thus, it can in future prove that you were not conforming to confirmation bias, for example by HARKing: rewriting your hypothesis after getting your results in order to get a significant result (Kerr, 1998; Forstmeier, Wagenmakers &amp; Parker, 2017). Confirmation bias is a problem in science because of the way that science is published. In brief, articles for journals with higher impact are regularly selected based on significant results. If you don’t have that significance, they are unlikely to want to take your manuscript. For this reason, many scientists have sought to have significant results to report, and this is called confirmation bias. Confirmation bias is bad because it violates the assumption that we are answering the hypothesis that we started with, or it could cause scientists to manipulate their data until a significant result is achieved. For example another form of confirmation bias is p hacking: repeating tests with different approaches in order to obtain a significant result. Rubin (2020) gives a good list and set of explanations. As there are a lot of known ways in which researchers have been thought to deliberately or accidentally report false-positive findings, one solution can be archiving your intentions, referred to as preregistration (Forstmeier, Wagenmakers &amp; Parker, 2017) see Figure 38.1. If you register your proposal (or any research plan), you can present this historical document to a journal (probably 4 to 5 years later) to show that you have done what you planned to do (see webinar on preregistration here). What have you got to lose? With a good proposal that you feel confident with, you have nothing to lose. By registering your proposal, you are most likely to gain, especially in the future if more journals require preregistered hypotheses and methods in order to submit to them. What this does mean is that you will need to do a good job of your proposal. This can be daunting when starting a new PhD, especially with respect to the analyses if you are not from a strong analytical background. Your proposal period should be time to make sure that your knowledge of analyses that you will do is sufficient. I would suggest that the best way to make sure that you are proficient is to obtain a working knowledge of how to handle a dataset such as the one you are going to generate in your experiment during your proposal period. If your lab already has similar datasets, borrow one. If not, generate some data that you can use. FIGURE 38.1: Preregistration of your research proposal is a step towards transparency in research. Preregistering your proposal formalises the first review process, while publishing your manuscript formalises the second (after Scheel, 2020). What if new analytical methods appear during the period, or you are forced to change your experimental protocol? Certainly, most analytical software will be updated over the course of your studies, and some might be superseded. None of this is a real problem to your preregistered content. Logging the software that you intend to use will demonstrate the approach and type of analyses that you intend to take. It is unlikely that you will ever be held to account for minor changes to equipment or protocol as things do change along the way. It doesn’t mean that you won’t be able to report your results, or that your research won’t be viable. But it does mean that you will need to be transparent about why it changed. For this reason, it is a good idea to document the changes to your proposed research plan and why they happened. It is surprisingly easy to forget! There are some great tools on different platforms for adding this information, together with a timestamp so that it’s clear when it was done. 38.1.1 Does this mean that you can’t perform any data exploration? Although at first sight, preregistration appears to confine you to only testing ideas that you had before you started a study, actually the opposite is true. When you preregister your proposal (or research plan) it places a time-stamp and, therefore, a historical trail on your ideas. If as you go along with your study you gain new insight and ideas, you can register these with their own time-stamp. When it comes to analysing your data, you use a separate section labelled ‘exploratory analyses’. You can then apply post-hoc rules to these findings, which will not stop you from reporting them, but gets around the awkwardness of HARKing. This serves to reinforce the distinction between prediction and postdiction. 38.1.2 Will preregistration of research eliminate the bias from science? It is probably too early to tell (Rubin, 2020), but it is certainly a good place to start (Nosek et al., 2018). The more researchers know and subscribe to transparency in their research, the more it will shift the culture in science for the better (Forstmeier, Wagenmakers &amp; Parker, 2017). However, there are more biases existing in science, and the system needs buy-in from stakeholders to promote equity by elimination of bias. A new initiative from Peer Community In is the possibility of submitting to their Registered Reports, which goes much further towards removing the confirmation bias. The Registered Report (RR) is in effect the registration of a proposal (i.e. preregistration) with review. If the RR is approved by reviewers then the study is, in principle, given the green light for publication whether or not the hypothesis posed is accepted or rejected. I say ‘in principle’ because those same reviewers are shown the manuscript again once the results are in. They need to check that the methods proposed were followed, the analyses were conducted in the same way they were proposed, and that the conclusions are justified by the results. In terms of Figure 38.1, Peer Community In are offering to organise the two yellow review arrows. In addition, there are a bunch of journals that have already signed up to accept RRs that are signed off after completion (notable among these is PeerJ). To me, this represents an important step in the right direction toward transparency, and the elimination of confirmation bias. What would be great to see is the number of conventional journals sign up with RRs based on the quality of the study design and execution, and the concomitant abandonment of Impact Factor as a driving force in publishing. 38.1.3 What Platform should you use? When choosing where to archive your proposal (or any of your data, analyses, etc.), there are lots of platforms to choose from: Bitbucket, Figshare, Github, OSF, Zenodo and the list will undoubtedly grow. Making a decision about what you are going to use now may not require that you stick with this same platform for your entire career, but there are some things that you should consider: Here are some of the considerations that you should take on board: What do people in your lab and institution use? It’ll be easier to use the same platform as your advisor and other lab members Some platforms require a subscription, check whether your institution is a member. Avoid using any platform that is tied to a publisher. Although it’s not possible to future proof this (as publishers have been shown to buy up anything they think will help them control the academic market), you can check how the platform is set up and opt for those that are non-profit organisations. Other important aspects are “open source”, free to use and access. Can the platform function for more than one aspect of transparency? As the need for transparency in science grows, it will become important to have more aspects of projects archived. Does the platform that you’ve chosen cover all the stages from conception to publication? Is it easy to use? Some of the platforms will be more intuitive to use, while others require a steep learning curve. Consider how friendly they may be to other collaborators, older advisors, etc. Are the archives easily compatible with other platforms? Working across platforms might be important for your project, especially if you start with collaborators that are already using different platforms. The platform you choose should work for you (rather than having you work for it). If you are someone who loves to have everything ordered and organised, then you’ll love seeing this all laid out. If you aren’t, then these platforms are going to be a massive help to getting all of your plans sorted. Make updating your platform a habit. For example, you could make sure that notes taken during meetings with your advisor on different projects are logged onto the platform. This way, you both have a record of what decision was made when. Remember that you can choose what you make accessible to the outside world. 38.2 Transparency as you move forwards There are a whole lot more transparency criteria that you will need to be aware of later on in your PhD when it comes to publishing. Becoming familiar with the entire process now will be to your advantage, so I encourage you to read more about this topic. Sullivan et al. (2019) provide a nice overview about how to get started, but be sure to consult documentation at OSF. References Forstmeier W, Wagenmakers E-J, Parker TH. 2017.

"],["funding.html", "Chapter 39 Generating funding for your PhD research 39.1 Funding databases 39.2 Reasons you might want to apply for funding:", " Chapter 39 Generating funding for your PhD research To be honest, writing a funding proposal is an art in itself and should be the subject of an entirely different book. What is written here is only really scratching the surface, so I suggest that if generating funding for your PhD research is going to be a large part of your work then you should look for an additional book. 39.1 Funding databases Funding is one of the most important aspects of doing science, and something that different emphasis is placed on in different parts of the world. In North America, in particular, some graduate students are expected to be able to demonstrate that they are able to raise their own funds, as this is expected of them in their jobs as academics. No matter where you are, your CV will be greatly improved by showing prospective employees (or labs) that you can generate your own funding. North America has a lot of opportunities to apply for funding for all sorts of reasons. There are less opportunities elsewhere, but the pool of people applying is also smaller. There are now so many opportunities, that several databases exist to help you find appropriate funding for your particular situation. I am only going to address some of these portals, and to quickly consider some of the major reasons why you might want to apply for funding. 39.2 Reasons you might want to apply for funding: To improve your CV. Even if it’s only a small amount of funding that you apply for, it will make your CV look better. You might also want to search for prizes. Academic prizes carry both money and that feel good, look good feeling that CVs need. Your project is unfunded. If you are completely unfunded, or you have a bursary but no running expenses, then you are going to need money to do your work. The more work (particularly field work) that you want to do, the more money you’ll need to raise. Your project is funded, but you want to do more. If you want to do a lot extra (like side projects or paying assistants to collect extra data) then all of this is possible if you can raise some more money to do it. You want to attend a conference or workshop. There are great opportunities for travelling around the world, but they cost money and international conferences are often very expensive. Publishing in Open Access journals. I find the idea of putting cash into the pockets of publishers abhorrent, but you may have little choice. There are some opportunities to get funding for OA publishing. It is clear that without making an application, you won’t get any funding. But where do you start? Databases. There are many databases, but here are 3 that are easy to use. 39.2.1 Mendeley:https://www.mendeley.com/ This is probably my favorite. It’s easy to use and apply or remove filters. You can use the same login that you have for the referencing software and SCOPUS. 39.2.2 Open 4 Research: https://www.open4research.eu For this you’ll need an academic email address to register, but you’ll get access to their research database. It is nice and logical to use, and you’ll find local and international funding opportunities. 39.2.3 Research Professional:https://www.researchprofessional.com/ You’ll need to create a login for this site, although you might get an in with your university address. This provides you access to what could well be the same database as those above. This is a slick database and relatively easy to use. 39.2.4 Opportunities in your department or societies: Probably the most likely place to get funding is where you already have an ‘in’ (where you are already known). This will include professional societies where you are a member, or your department or university. These places also have prizes, so it’s good that you know what is on offer in order to benefit the most.

It shows that you care deeply about your work. However, when it gets so bad that you can’t hand work in any more, then something has gone wrong. It is possible that you are suffering from impostor syndrome. 40.1 What is impostor syndrome? Impostor syndrome is an experience you have when you believe that you are not as competent as you think others perceive you to be. It is not uncommon in many professions, and especially prevalent in academia (Clance &amp; Imes, 1978). This is now widely recognised and there are lots of useful shared experience out there to read (e.g. Dickerson, 2019). FIGURE 40.1: It is common to worry about handing in your work. Many people feel conflicted about whether or not they should hand in their work. Is this part of imposter syndrome? Are you fearful that your work won’t be well received (Figure 40.1)? Is it really up to the standards that are required? Could you do better if you just spent some more time? These are all really common thoughts, and they go along with ‘imposter syndrome’ for a lot of early career (and even older) academics Hutchins &amp; Rainbolt (2017). There are some important points to think about here: Everybody has these ideas and you aren’t alone Handing in work and getting feedback is part of the learning experience The fact that you care so much about your work and how it is perceived is a good thing. If you didn’t care, then this would be a problem. If you never hand anything in, you won’t get your post-graduate degree 40.2 Think of it this way The process of writing is part of your learning process, and you aren’t learning alone. That’s why you have an advisor. While you think that there may be a great intellectual gap between you and your advisor, I can promise you that there isn’t. But your advisor is an experienced reader. Hopefully, there have been many students who have benefited from learning with your advisor (talk to them about their experience). They already work with a lot of students and help those people to bring their writing to a level where it can be accepted by an academic community. Like other members of the academic community, your advisor also has experience of receiving critical feedback about their written work. Sometimes it is painful and sometimes it feels personal. But getting feedback (or peer review) is a fundamental part of the publishing process. Talk to your advisor and other lab members about this process. Ask people how they overcame their fear of submitting written work. 40.3 What can you do to help yourself overcome the fear of submitting written work? Give it to a friend or colleague to read Remember that most of what you write should be understandable to the majority of people around you. This means that you can give your written work to fellow postgraduates and postdocs and ask for feedback. Annotate your text with places where you are particularly unsure. If there’s a certain part that you are struggling with, annotate it (add comment) and point out that you are struggling with this particular section Ask for a meeting with your advisor. You can sit down together with your advisor and discuss the points where you are uncertain before handing in the work. Or, after you’ve written it you can ask for a session when you are given verbal feedback Produce a checklist. If you specifically worry that there may be errors in what you write (grammatical, spelling, plagiarism), then make a checklist that you can tick off prior to submitting. Once your check list is done, don’t mess with the written work again (or you could add more errors), just hand it in! Set a deadline for yourself. If you don’t already have one, having a set of deadlines that you give yourself to give your writing to colleagues and hand in to your advisor. If you know that you aren’t good with deadlines, share them with as many people as you can! Provide yourself with a reward for submitting your work. Rewards are a really simple way of helping you to do things. They help simplify otherwise apparently complex fears. Tell your advisor about your fears. There’s nothing like honesty. Your advisor may be able to cut you some slack, or might sit down with you and look at how the two of you can overcome this difficulty. If you have more than one advisor, there may be one who you are more confident to read your work, and you can suggest that reading is done in series (instead of in parallel - actually, I’d advise this). Talk to your advisor about what really gets you the most upset. In case it’s something that your advisor does that makes you anxious. If you can’t do this face to face, then you could annotate it in a reply to their comment. The chance is that your advisor doesn’t know how upsetting it is and you’ll be helping them in their future interactions with students. Ask your advisor about their fear of handing in and get them (and others in your lab) to share their stories (for example at a lab meeting). You might find that you have common ground to start sharing how these problems can be overcome. At the end of the day, this is teamwork. Either you and your advisor are a team, or there are a bunch of advisors helping you. It is in everybody’s interest that the job gets done. Getting a line of dialogue moving with your advisor is essential, even if you have to arrange a meeting about a different subject and then introduce the problem later in the meeting. There are deadlines that need to be kept. You need to find a way of getting through the fear, and if it’s going to be a persistent problem, you’ll need to work out what works best for you. 40.4 When is it good enough to submit to my advisor? Once you’ve read and revised the draft text three times yourself, and you feel that you can’t really improve it any more, hand it over. Personally, I need to wait a day or more between drafts when I work on something else, or do some reading. I find that it really helps to think about writing while not writing. Run through the arguments in your head when you are doing something else. That could be time in the gym, out running, cycling or swimming. Or talk through the logic of your argument with a friend or colleague while having coffee. You’ll find that spending time thinking away from sitting in front of your word-processor will be really valuable in promoting productivity once you sit down again. If you are fearful of handing in your work, share it with others to give you confidence. Hand it to an office mate or other friend first. Your reader shouldn’t have to be an expert in your field, but only needs to have a loose grasp on scientific writing to follow any paper. As a guide, any recent graduate of a biological sciences degree (BSc) should be able to understand. This makes it easy to find lots of potential readers for your manuscript before handing it in.

Very few people can sit down at a desk and write an academic paper from beginning to end. For most of us, it takes a lot of hard work over many weeks or even months to write something that can be submitted for peer review. In the third part of this book, I approach the writing of a chapter or a paper for peer review in the same formulaic way, and will refer to papers or chapters interchangeably. Sometimes it seems that every paper I read is just repeating the same formula over and over again. I even tend to forget that it’s there until someone breaks the mould. Breaking the mould produces papers that really stand out, captivating the reader straight away. So why aren’t we writing those manuscripts every time we write a paper? Moreover, why don’t we teach students to write standout papers that will captivate everyone. Should we really be teaching formulaic writing? Here I argue that not only is writing to a formula good practice, but it’s the best way to learn scientific writing. When you look to see who is writing those knock-out articles (i.e. “broken mould”), the answer is that they are really experienced researchers who have written hundreds of papers, and (unlike some of us) in doing so have learnt the essence of great writing. Such greatness is not innate and comes rarely to any researchers (even those who have written hundreds of papers). That’s why I suggest to my students that they follow the formulas that are by now well recorded in many blogs and websites on scientific writing. There is another reason why writing to a formula is recommended. Not only is it easier, but because it is so common and widespread, it also gives the reader a familiarity with reading your work. This means that editors are able to skim through and find exactly what makes your work worth publishing, and it means that those who are only semi-interested are more likely to find what they need to cite in your work. 41.1 So what is the formula? If we were in my office, at this point in the meeting I usually go to my white board and start drawing funnels (as a metaphor) and blocks. However, others have much better diagrams and here I’ve adapted an idea from Brian McGill’s blog (2016). But you can also find other useful material in other papers Tomaska (2007). If you are of the Twitter persuasion, you get lots of useful tips and links from WriteThatPhD and Write4Research. The diagram below (Figure 41.1) is supposed to show the movement of a liquid medium from one vessel to another. This is to make you think of your readers’ understanding moving fluidly from one section to another. The introduction concentrates the ideas into your particular approach, while the discussion allows the reader to understand how your results fit into the larger body of knowledge. FIGURE 41.1: Using a formulaic approach to writing your PhD chapter. This diagram represents the formula of writing a paper or chapter that we will concentrate on in this book. Imagine the flow of the reader being like a liquid that passes from one section to the next. 41.1.1 My take on how to write a formula paper But what goes into the top, and perhaps more importantly, what comes out of the bottom? I’d like for the discussion to end in a greater understanding of the system for the reader. But maybe if we could also inspire the reader to read more, that would be a great result. My suggestion is that you now go and read 5 relevant papers in your field and annotate them to see how well they fit into the formula described above. This will give you a practical idea of how the formula is put into practice. References McGill B. 2016.The 5 pivotal paragraphs in a paper.

Some failure to backup stories are truly horrific. However, they all represent a failure on the part of the person involved to properly backup their work. At the time of writing, it is very easy to keep copies of documents in the Cloud, or even write straight into the Cloud. Talk to your advisor about what options are available in your institution for backing up your work. Make a plan early on, before you start with your study, and then stick with that backup plan as you move through your PhD. A really good option is to start working in one of the Open Science platforms. For example, OSF allows you to create a project where you can continue to use lots of different Cloud based resources, and provides an integrated home for them. OSF is also a great platform as it is free to use, and as long as individual files are less than 5 Gb, OSF will host them. This means that for most projects, raw data files can be stored in the Cloud at no cost to the project. 42.1 Should the cloud be the only copy of your data? No. I suggest that you keep a hard drive with a copy of your data that you regularly update on a monthly basis, or after significant bouts of data collection such as field trips or experiments. A hard drive has the advantage that in the case of an internet outage, you always have access to your data. Don’t try to store data on a laptop or desktop computer. These are for working files only. Backup is a separate operation where you store files. While computers are good for computation, they are frail and much more likely to suffer from catastrophic failures. They are also objects that are prone to being stolen. 42.2 Backing up in the field If you are going to be doing lots of field work, then you might want to make a specific plan about backing up data to the cloud during field time. It may seem expensive, but I’m sure that it won’t be as expensive as losing the data. Alternatively, or in addition, you may want to take a portable storage option. I still prefer field notes and data to be written into a book (preferably with waterproof paper such as ‘rite in the rain’). This allows you to make a photographic backup of the hard copy. Similarly, you can design datasheets that you use in the field with a pencil, and then photograph them to make a soft copy from your hard copy. I don’t like entering data directly into a laptop or other device. For me, the advantage is that it is too easy to mis-type a data point into a device, and then there is no record about what it should have been. These days there are multiple different ways to enter data into devices (including dictation), and so you should make your own plan about what you feel most comfortable with. If you do make a hard copy, you will then have to transcribe it later. If you make mistakes, you can go back to the hard copy. 42.3 Make a data management plan, and stick to it However you decide to manage your data, make sure that you have a plan and that you stick to it. Don’t become a victim of some unexpected event that will lose your data. These events will still happen, but at least your existing data will be safe. Creating a secure data management plan (Figure 42.1) is something that you should design and then talk through with your advisor. There is much more to data management than simply backing up your data. A great start is to read through the British Ecological Society’s guide to Data Management. See part 3 for information about how to archive and distribute your data. FIGURE 42.1: The data management cycle. It is possible to see your data as a cycle between creation and distribution. Your plan should aim to cover each of these steps (redrawn from the British Ecological Society’s guide to Data Management). You probably won’t be able to think about all the potential pitfalls that may happen during your PhD, but if there are some obvious ones, then do consider them and see whether you can mitigate the circumstances should they occur. "],["part3.html", "Chapter 43 Writing the sections that make up your data chapter", " Chapter 43 Writing the sections that make up your data chapter Getting over the cognitive inertia of starting to write is top of the list for most of us. The approach provided here is to present you with a formula that breaks down each section into smaller more reasonably sized chunks. However, you still need to make a start. Procrastinating starting to write is normal. It seems a massive task, even if you’ve done it lots of times before. You want to write the best manuscript that you can, but you aren’t feeling on top form today, so doesn’t it seem a better idea to wait until tomorrow? It’s not. You must start today and start now. Don’t set the bar so high for your first draft. In fact, don’t set any bar other than a personal goal of getting the first draft done. For the first draft, type away confident in the knowledge that 90% of the first draft will get junked or changed so much that you won’t recognise it. That’s ok, and it’s not a waste of your time. In fact, the first draft is invaluable in getting your ideas and perspective down on paper, allowing you to better organise and sift through your thoughts and bring clarity to your manuscript. Allow yourself a reward for finishing your first draft, something that you won’t do until it’s done. You can make life easier for yourself by changing the order of what you write. Although I have placed the contents of this chapter as you’d expect to see them in a typical paper, this is not the order I would suggest that you write them in. The most important part of writing up your chapter or paper is to have your hypothesis or question clearly stated. Once you have this, it will help you to know the literature that is already there and so writing the introduction next seems logical. Of course, you may already have your proposal to work with, in which case you can start by reviewing what you already have and deciding whether or not you need to tweak this, or if you need a fresh start. The methods and materials are the easiest section to write first, especially if you’ve already done the practical work. This section will also help you focus on the analysis that you are doing for the results. Again you should review your proposal and see whether there were any significant changes to your planned methodology and note them down. This will not be an issue even if you have preregistered your proposal, you simply need to provide a rational explanation for why things changed. Next, write the results. Remember that you are only looking to respond to your hypotheses, preferably using your (preregistered) proposal plans. Tables and figures are compiled along with the results. Now you have the materials and methods together with the results in full. I suggest that you make a list of all the relevant discussion points you want to make and then turn your attention to the introduction. Begin with an outline, before you flesh it out. Lastly, write the abstract. Populate your article with references as you write. While you can leave the formatting of references until the end, it’s dangerous to not put citations in as you write as you are likely to forget which paper is which by the end. "],["title.html", "Chapter 44 Title page 44.1 The title 44.2 Key-words", " Chapter 44 Title page Most of the following information in this section on the title pertain to getting a manuscript ready for submission to a journal. For your thesis, I would recommend that you have a title page for each chapter that lists any collaborators and their contributions so that this is transparent for the examiners. It also helps break up the document and can be a good spot for a non-academic illustration (if your institution permits). Nearly all journals will require you to have a title page for your manuscript. This may or may not include authors. Check to see whether the journal that you are submitting to conducts double-blind review. If they do, they will require a title page without any indication of authors or institutions (they will also likely ask you to remove the acknowledgements section). This should be clearly specified in the instructions to authors of your chosen journal. 44.0.1 Names and addresses are important Getting authors’ names correct, their correct addresses (many people have more than one affiliation), can be tricky. Check that you have all of the information required for a title page before you submit. While you need the names of your co-authors to be displayed correctly, you do not need their titles (no Dr. or Prof., etc.). Indicate clearly who is the corresponding author. Normally, if you have done all of the rest of the work, the corresponding author should be you. You need to learn how to start this role at some point, so it might as well be now. Having the correct name and address will be important to each author. Along with the author names and addresses you should record the ORCID of each author. The ORCID is simply a unique identification code for individual researchers. ORCID is a non-profit organisation and there’s nothing sinister in signing up. If they (or you) don’t have one, then you should ask them to create one before the submission. It takes less than 5 minutes. Go to www.orcid.org 44.1 The title The title of your paper, chapter or book is the first thing that any reader will read, and so should be well considered. If your reader cannot quickly understand your title, the chances are that they won’t bother reading any further. Your title will be your selling point, and your aim is to use it to draw your readership in. Once you’ve managed to inveigle your readers to download your paper, your title is also their hook for remembering your paper in their database of thousands of others. Having their key-word in your title will help here, and as ever with writing your challenge is to think like your reader. The best titles are those that sum up the entire study in five to seven words. This is best done in a narrative that tells the story (see part 2) of your manuscript in its entirety. This may sound daunting, but you should get into the habit of summing up your story quickly (for friends, relatives and work colleagues). Then it’s a question of refining this story into the short single sentence that makes up the title. While the narrative approach may not work for you, you do want the title to provide enough information so that the potential reader knows what they will find before they open it. Your title doesn’t just have to work for you, it needs to work for a wide audience. Some people are excellent at writing titles that contain puns of well-known phrases or sayings. These can be brilliant, working both to inform what’s in the paper as well as providing some familiar input that helps retain them in memory. However, many fail to do either and are simply a waste of space. If you are tempted to use a pun as your title, make sure that it is widely appreciated, and not just among your co-authors and lab. You don’t have to come up with a killer title from day one. Most of my manuscripts have a working title that gets revised as I write, and is always open for change before submission. If you have great ideas for a title, do note them down. I find that the more options I have, the more likely I am to come up with something that works for everyone. It also helps to mix and match from a set of candidate titles. Once you have come up with something that looks good to you and your colleagues, test it by entering it into your database of choice (with the default being Google Scholar). Your first 10 results should include a set of papers that you have likely cited in the upper area of your introduction. If you don’t recognise any out of the top 10, it’s time to look at another of your candidate titles. 44.1.1 Some title ideas to start you off Don’t start by looking for the best title Write a number of candidate titles and ask your co-authors to vote for their favourites. The shorter and catchier your title can be the better: 6 words (±1) is an ideal. Allow yourself a longer subtitle if needed, but don’t go over 20 words total (some journals may limit your total to less). Consider the (former) 120 character limit of a Tweet as an upper limit Do include your principal finding if possible Include as many key-words as you can 44.1.2 Things to avoid in your title Don’t feel obliged to include taxonomic terms unless it is relevant or compulsory Some (taxonomically minded) journals will insist on the species name followed by the taxonomic authority, and/or the family and order, in your title Avoid obscure or specialist words that won’t be understood by your readership There are times when key words are necessarily specialised and your readership will expect this, but simpler words in your title will open up your readership which will otherwise remain narrow Don’t simply define the scope of your work without including your content. Don’t have your title as a question. Rather provide the answer! 44.2 Key-words The key-words are a way for readers to find your content with searches. Typically, the advice is to use words that are not in the title or abstract. This is because many databases have combined searching facilities for title, abstract and key-words. I struggle to think of appropriate key-words, and so make a list of some of the big idea words and short phrases from the introduction. Then I tend to look at articles in the same genre, and see what key-words they have used. As with the title, I suggest that you enter your chosen key-words into your literature database of choice see part 2 and see what comes back. You should see a group of papers that look wholly familiar and preferably those that are already cited in your manuscript. If not, it’s time to look again. 44.2.1 Selecting appropriate key-words Key-words are very useful in your studies, because if you have a good selection, they can help nail down a good proportion of the literature that you will need to read during your studies. Moreover, if you have the best selection of key-words, then you can set up some automated notifications for when new items are published. The only problem then is pulling together the correct key-words. When you submit a conference abstract, or a paper for publication, you will also be faced by a demand for key-words. This is when I often draw a blank. What will be the appropriate key-words for my study? I can often think of one or two, but regularly journals want at least five. A method for finding key-words Here is my method for finding appropriate key-words. It’s quick, but it does require a piece of free-ware: VOSviewer, which for me has become an invaluable research tool. Go to your literature database of choice (i.e. Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, Dimensions.) Search for documents using the key-words that you are sure are appropriate Constrain the results to ~500 documents You can either do this with the search date (e.g. the most recent 5 years) Or you can simply take the first 500 documents that are found Download these ~500 documents in a tab delimited text file. In VOSviewer Press the ‘create’ button Create a map based on bibliographic data Read data from bibliographic database files Select the file that you downloaded in the appropriate tab Type of analysis Co-occurrence All keywords (you can choose here) Full counting You should see the total number of key-words in your downloaded file now Change the minimum number of occurrences of a key-word so that you have ~100 results (again you can choose what suits you) Press finish You should end up with a network like the one below. Here I have used the key-words “invasive” and “fish” (Figure 44.1). FIGURE 44.1: A network of key-words for “invasive” and “fish”. This network represents key-words that are repeated 10 times or more in the Web of Science together with “invasive” and “fish”. In VOSviewer, you can highlight any one of these key-words and see exactly what combination they have been used in. I have selected examples that occur 10 or more times in my downloaded file. This means that I can be fairly sure that these are relatively common key-words to use in combination with the ones I know are good. The larger the panel in this network, the more frequently the word is used (see “invasive species” in Figure 44.1). This should help you when you select your own key-words. For example, even though I had used the keywords “invasive” and “fish” to generate this network, one of the first things I noticed is that the term “invasive species” is far more common than “invasive”. Hence, the first thing I should do is to change the first of my key-words. You should note in Figure 44.1 that some of the key-words relate to specific taxonomic groups. Others include the habitat in which the fish were sampled. Now I have a shortlist from which to pick the remaining 5 key-words that I need in order to submit my abstract or manuscript. Once you’ve made your selection, you can go back to your literature database, add this combination of key-words into a search and see what comes out. If you’ve done it right, you should see some familiar papers on similar topics to your own.

In a world where the quantity of scientific literature is increasing, it is more likely that someone will read your abstract but not your paper. Actually, it’s far more likely that someone will read your title and use that to decide whether or not to look at the abstract. Moreover, when you submit your work to the journal, your editor may decide whether or not to immediately reject your manuscript based on the content of the abstract. Therefore, it had better be good! 45.1 What is the abstract? The abstract is a concise paragraph that sums up the major points of your manuscript so that the potential reader will be able to assess whether or not they want to read the entire paper. It is an abstract of the entire document. The abstract is a standalone text. The reader should not have to consult more widely in order to make sense of what they are reading - hence there are no citations in an abstract. 45.2 So what would a good abstract contain? A good abstract is a summary of the highlights of the paper. You can’t hope to include all of the results, but you should include sample sizes, variables and relevant statistics when they support your major hypotheses. You must include the broader subject area that your study fits into, and show how your results are relevant to this. None of this is easy, and you should not expect to write your abstract in a single sitting. It will likely require multiple iterations, and some intense wordsmithing to make it as good as it can be. Abstracts almost always have a word limit, and that makes it challenging and means that you have to be concise see part 2. Increasingly, you’ll hear that a good abstract is citable. This means that it contains enough information that someone knows that it can be used to cite for a specific fact. Of course, these people should download and read the entire study, but there is no guarantee that they will. 45.3 Where do you start? Just like planning your writing in general, I’d suggest starting your abstract with an outline. Use bullet points to make a list of things that you feel that you should include. Rearrange your list until you have all the introduction points at the start, results in the middle and discussion at the end. There’s no need for detailed methodology, but it is useful to know the approach. For example, ‘we used a common garden experimental approach’ or ‘we sampled 85 animals from three invasive populations’. Although many abstracts are provided as a single paragraph, some are structured into the sections of the paper, or as numbered points. Using this formula is a good way to get disciplined about boiling your paper down into a small amount of concise words. It’s worth keeping a copy of any abstract that you compose like this in case you decide to submit to a journal that requires it. Starting with this framework will ensure that the abstract is well balanced. At this point, I’d circulate it to your advisor to ask whether there are other key points that should be included. As a rule, it’s easier to start with everything present, and only then cut the words down to something within the abstract word limit. If you wordsmith your abstract and then try and add a key point later, it’ll never come out so well. 45.4 When do you write your abstract? Although the abstract comes on page 1 of your manuscript, only try to write it once you’ve got to the end of the process of writing your manuscript so that you are aware of all the major points that you need to include. Maybe once you’ve submitted your second draft of the manuscript to your advisor (given that you are both happy with the content), you can formulate the abstract. 45.5 Do abstracts for conferences differ? Yes. It’s likely that an abstract for a talk will not be the same, unless you have already published the study: but even then it’s probably worth re-writing it. I’d suggest that your conference abstract be more descriptive and thought-provoking, such that it is aimed toward the specific audience of the conference. Pose questions that you will answer in your talk. 45.6 Can I use citations in the abstract? No. This is not a good idea as it defeats the object of the abstract as a standalone text. There are some legitimate times when you might need to use a citation in an abstract (although they are very rare). For example, if all of your manuscript refers to a single previously published paper, and the abstract does not make sense without knowledge of this publication. If you really need to, you can read more about how to cite in the abstract in Part 1. 45.7 Where do people go wrong in writing the abstract? The most common mistake is getting the balance wrong. I often see an abstract that gets to the results, runs out of space and simply stops. It is important to have a statement about your interpretation of the results which relates back to your hypothesis. Another common mistake is to have a very simply worded abstract that conveys very little information. There is definitely going to be a lot to put in, so expect to write something too long with too much content, and then cut it down by discussing with your advisor what can be left out. Text from the main document is copied into the abstract. I’ve written about this elsewhere, but you should never duplicate text within your document. You could start like this, but wordsmithing must change the words and their order substantially. Otherwise, when the first sentence of the abstract is the same as the first sentence of the manuscript, it will really turn off your readers. Too many statistics or their complete absence are also common mistakes. Adding numbers and statistics are important, especially when they can take the place of more words. There is only time for one or two comments on the discussion, so pick out the most important. Look through your written discussion and rank the points that you make in terms of interest to others. Can you combine two or more points into a single sentence? The introduction of the abstract must frame the bigger question, and the discussion must show how your data responds to this. Don’t be tempted to overreach with your claims in the abstract (or the main text). Include major caveats when they are relevant. Finish with something conclusive and strong, preferably how this study changes the understanding, and not a caveat or suggested further study. The abstract does not contain citations (or very rarely and only if unavoidable), so don’t put any in! If you have to have a citation in your abstract, then it must include sufficient information that it can be found without opening up the paper: first author, abbreviated journal name, volume, first page.

"],["introduction.html", "Chapter 46 The Introduction 46.1 Why do we need an introduction? 46.2 So what do we put into the introduction? 46.3 And the construction…? 46.4 Summing up", " Chapter 46 The Introduction 46.1 Why do we need an introduction? The introduction and discussion appear to be two common stumbling points for students writing chapters or manuscripts. First, what to put in and what to leave out. And second how to construct it. They are complementary, and if written well can be read without the Materials and Methods or Results, with the reader still gaining all of the major information of the manuscript. The introduction is going to be the first part of your manuscript that anyone reads. Yes, they’ve already taken in the title and the abstract. These are almost like bait to draw readers in. The meat starts with the introduction. And it’s not only important to get all the correct content in there, but it’s also important not to give misleading information that might distract the reader. When you write the introduction to a paper, you must not be tempted to stray away from what we are aiming to introduce. The aim of our introduction is to explain to the reader the hypothesis you are testing, and the approach you have taken to test it. 46.2 So what do we put into the introduction? The hypothesis itself is made up of different parts, and each of these must be explained in the introduction. We also need to understand the approach that you’ve decided to take in your study (e.g. experimental, lab or field approach, observations or natural history). All of these decisions that you made were informed by the literature, as is your general understanding of the subject that you are studying. So making sure that you cite (read about citing) the relevant literature is a key ingredient of the introduction. However, this is where I think many people get side tracked. Researchers love reading, and it’s super easy to get sucked into all the amazing things that people have done in an ever expanding and increasingly interesting literature. We are often tempted to show exactly how well read we are. Or put in that fascinating tit-bit that we stumbled on by accident. However, you must keep focussed on the goal, to introduce the hypothesis to the reader, and try not to allow yourself (and consequently your reader) to get distracted. Consider this analogy: You can think of the introduction as being a highway to your hypothesis. As you drive the highway, it’s fine to see signposts that lead to other places, but don’t be tempted to turn off the highway to visit them. You do need to take your reader to your question as efficiently as you can. Point out the relevant sites on the way, but don’t stop until you get where you’re going. 46.2.1 The hypothesis at the heart of the formula Having made the point that the formula is funnelling the readers’ interest, the question arises: to what? What are we working towards? Why are we so interested in having the reader focus on a particular thing, and more importantly: what is that thing? The Hypothesis Your hypothesis is the reason that you are conducting your study. You are trying to respond to it, trying to accept or reject it. Your hypothesis is why you are doing the study and you need your reader to get the context for this, and to understand exactly why it was that you posed this specific hypothesis. The hypothesis is then at the heart of everything that you write in your chapter (Figure 46.1): Your introduction explains why you posed the hypothesis Your methods &amp; materials describe how you went about testing your hypothesis Your results provide the outcome of the tests of your hypothesis Your discussion responds to your hypothesis and provides the context FIGURE 46.1: Your hypothesis lies at the heart of your PhD chapter. Your hypothesis (red star) is at the heart of everything that you are writing about. The entire reason for providing the chapter is to test your idea. 46.3 And the construction…? Previously, I’ve described the introduction like a funnel (Figure 46.2), where we channel the reader into our hypothesis by starting broad and ending up narrow (see the formula). This can draw criticism that journal articles are expected to fit a certain style, that this style is boring, and that what we really need is for people to write in a more exciting and varied way. Although I do not disagree with this, my objective here, is to try to demystify writing and enable you to get started. The easiest way to get started is, I believe, through a formula. But it is important to say that the funnel isn’t the only way, and I’ve read some great papers where the first sentence of the introduction is the hypothesis. However you do it, the hypothesis is at the heart of your introduction because it is the reason for your work. FIGURE 46.2: The introduction funnel. My suggestion is to keep to the funnel if you want to make life easier for yourself. Start by writing an outline of where you want your text to go. Then add in the references that are pertinent to each paragraph of the outline. Make sure that there aren’t any paragraphs with a single citation repeated over and again; it’s more likely that there is a lot more relevant information out there. TABLE 46.1: Here is a guide to the contents of each paragraph of your introduction. Although you should not feel constrained by this suggestion, it might help you get started when planning your bullet-pointed structure of the introduction before you start writing. Paragraph Description of contents Paragraph 1 Overview of the relevance of the major theme Paragraph 2 Identify knowledge gaps in the field. Paragraph 3 Identify the problem and the gaps you intend to fill. Introduce the important variables that your hypothesis includes. It’s not impossible to mention others, just don’t get distracted. Paragraph 4 Introduce the approach that you are using, and the organism of choice. Paragraph 5 Clearly state the hypotheses that are to be tested. Note that you can shuffle your paragraphs in Table 46.1 to the point where it still makes sense to the reader. Don’t be overly strict or dogmatic with this (or any) advice. For example, there may be more than 5 paragraphs, but use the framework to get started. Do what works for you in your situation. But beware of making any introduction too long. I suggest that you keep your outline with you as you write and develop the introduction. It is important that you remember the objective of each paragraph. Sometimes, you can put it away, then when you bring it out again and start working on it you find that it changes into something else. At this point, you need to make a judgement on whether it has changed into something better. You can only really make this judgement if you remember what your original objective was. When you think that it has become a better paragraph, you need to check that it still meets your original objectives. If it doesn’t, then you’ll need to decide whether or not that objective was met elsewhere. Now that you’ve fleshed out your outline with relevant citations, it’ll be time to pass it by your advisor to check that you are moving in the right direction before you start writing. My suggestion is always to use your advisor to get the advice that you need – that’s what they’re there for! 46.3.1 Should you include the results when introducing your study? How do you keep an idiot in suspense? I’ll tell you later… Increasingly, more scientists are including a concise statement during the last paragraph that responds to the hypothesis and states what the major outcome of the study is. The arguments for and against this have been made elsewhere (Heard, 2024), and I will attempt to summarise them here: Against: This is not the convention in science Results do not appear in the introduction You are giving away the result For: Science writing is not like writing a murder mystery novel If it helps readers then we should do it Convention is not a good reason for adherence In this guide, I have emphasised that the formulaic approach to writing advocated here is to help you get started as a writer. One of your goals should be to experiment with your writing and if you think that moving away from the formula is going to improve clarity and readability, then I think you should go for it. Next, I think that you should elicit feedback from peers and your advisor. The formula I have presented is conventional, and that’s deliberate. I am not going to tell you that it is the best way of writing your particular thesis chapter, and I would go so far as to say that shaking up convention is a very positive thing to do. But if you are struggling with getting started, then I am going to continue to advise you to stick to the conventional way. As it’s tried and tested you can be confident that this way is going to advance you towards your goal of writing your PhD. 46.4 Summing up The aim of your introduction is to provide the reader with all of the background information necessary to understand your study. Although the contents of this section on writing the introduction are somewhat brief, much of Part II concerns writing style that is applicable to your introduction. In particular, sections on composing your hypothesis (or not), writing a paragraph, and an argument should be referred to when you are writing your introduction.

For most people, it’s a relatively simple exercise, but here are some pointers to get you started. The Materials and Methods section should be citation dense, especially if you have used standard methods that have been written up elsewhere. If there are different methods, you should also explain why you used one over the other, as reviewers or examiners may require this. If you are introducing new methodologies, then you can expect to write a lot in this section about exactly how this was done, as well as the background to the reasons why the new approach to the methodology was taken. Your aim is to produce a coherent methodology that anyone in the next 200 years (or more) can pick up and follow in order to replicate your study. (ref:methods) There’s nothing to writing the methods except remaining methodical. Your methods are likely to have some generic aspects to other study types in your field of biological sciences. FIGURE 47.1: (ref:methods) One important aspect of your methods is that as they all happened in the past, it is often the only part of your chapter where you will write it in the past tense. You will see that some people manage to use the active voice (avoiding the passive voice) when writing their methods. Pay attention to the tense you use in your methods section, and make sure that you are consistent. 47.1 Sections or subheadings As ever, I’m going to recommend inserting section headers into your Materials and Methods to help you break it up into bite sized chunks (Figure 47.1). These are principally for the reader, but will also make your job easier. An important point here is to make sure that you keep your variables (what you are measuring to test your question) out of the sections like study organism and animal husbandry. Don’t be tempted to scatter variables and how you measured them throughout the Materials and Methods section. Keep them clear and maintain a logical flow, using a timeline if that makes sense. 47.2 Study organism or study system Having already written the introduction, you will know that there isn’t too much space to write a lot of information about your study organism there. However, often there is important background information that is needed on the species, which would be distracting or lose the flow of the introduction. By having a ‘Study Organism’ section at the start of your Materials and Methods, you can add in all relevant information in a paragraph or two. For example, if you are working on mice, Mus musculus, as a model organism you will want to use this space to describe why they are a good system for this particular investigation. Alternatively, your study could be detailing their invasion biology, in which case this would be the section where you can explain their distribution, or that they are invasive on all continents. You probably won’t need all of these points, but just the aspects of this species’ biology that is relevant to your study. You should make sure you know whether or not the journal requires the taxonomic authority. If you are not sure, include it now (see here for an explanation). Similarly, if you are working on invasive zebra fish, Danio rerio, you can write in this section the known dates when they were introduced to Japan, and how we know where those animals came from. You can also give details of their natural range in South Asia. If you are working on a community of animals, or it is the geographical region that is more important than any single species, you should explain the study system here. For example, if your study is about the rainforest, then you should provide some background information about this kind of vegetation here. If relevant, you may need to provide a map with the location of samples that you used in this section. My preference is to try to provide a composite figure that will also include an image of your study organism (if relevant). 47.3 Animal husbandry / Growing conditions / Culturing techniques If you have kept animals in the lab, grown plants or cultured bacteria in order to do your experiments, then you need to provide details of how you did this. For plants, this will include all relevant information on their source, propagation, growth medium and climatic regimes. For animals, you need to include their source, welfare, housing, feeding, light:dark cycles, temperature, etc. If you bred animals to produce your study life-history stage, all relevant information is needed here. All this information should be available from your ethics application. Some journals will want you to include the details of your ethics permission here. 47.4 Repetitive methodology If you’ve used the same methodology for each part of your data collection (like DNA extraction, sequencing, etc.), you should have a section that explains all of this prior to any experimental manipulations done. I would suggest that this is detailed in the first relevant chapter of your thesis, and then referred to in later chapters (see section on generative recycling). It’s best to go to look to see what other people have reported on in order to know what level of detail to include. For example, 20 years ago, it would have been important to include detailed information of how you extracted DNA from tissues. Today, you can probably say that you used a standard extraction kit without saying more. 47.5 Do you need to include formulae? Some of your methodologies will include calculations that rest on mathematical formula which can be written in mathematical notation. Certainly, there are plenty of examples in the biological sciences, especially in modelling, where these formulas are needed because they are developed within the methodology in order to produce the results. If your thesis involves this type of mathematical progression, then you will already know this is expected because all of the literature that you read will contain equations and formulas. However, if you are calculating (for example) the surface areas of a leaf, through a set of measurements, do you need to provide the formula you used in your materials and methods? I would move ahead on the premise that formulas that are well established in the literature need only be referenced, and not quoted. If you are building on any formula with new variables introduced by you in your study for the first time, then you will need to show the progression of these formulas. Remember that equations, formulas and theorems are all numbered in the text in a way that you can make reference to them later. 47.6 Experimental manipulations and data collection If you have done more than one kind of experiment, it’s probably a good idea to give each a separate subheading. Be consistent with these subheadings between the Materials and Methods and the results. One very important point here is to fully explain the collection of all of the variables that are used in your analyses. Remember to use exactly the same names for your variables here, as you have in the introduction (and will use in your figures and results sections). It’s very important that the reader gets this consistency across sections. Please also remember to include all units that you collect data in (there is a space between numbers and units!), and the accuracy of the measuring equipment used. Your variables may be sufficiently complicated that you need to add extra subsections in order to accommodate and explain them properly. This is fine. It’s also a good idea to use a table to explain a complicated sampling regime, or even a flow diagram. If you find yourself having trouble getting all of the information across in words, then go back to drawing a diagram that explains your data collection and ask around to see whether others find this an easier way to understand your setup. Diagrams and/or tables are there to replace words, so once you’ve decided which you want to include, you can delete the rest. 47.6.1 International System of Units (SI) The International System of Units (it’s proper name is in French: Le Système International d’Unitès, SI) is very important in all parts of science as it allows for reproducibility of the quantities of materials in your methods. As such, it is very important that you get these SI units correct in your methods (and in all parts of your chapter). Please also remember to include all units that you collect data in. Using SI units also means putting in a space between numbers and units: Change 25g to 25 g Change 42mm to 42 mm Change 42ºC to 42 ºC Using the space between the numbers and the units makes sense as the units are abbreviations for words. I would say that the exception to this is ºC. If we were talking about a right angle at 90º, we would not add a space between the number and the degree symbol. The next important point is to be cognisant of the accuracy of the equipment that you used. For example, state that you measured length in mm using digital callipers (to the nearest 0.01 mm). Once you have stated the accuracy of your measurements in your methods, be aware that you should not have excessive decimal places in your results. If you report that your plant has mean leaf length of 23.33254 mm, but as you only measured it to two decimal places, you should report the mean as 23.33 mm. 47.6.2 Equipment Many journals require that you name the company that you bought equipment from as well as the town and country where it was made. This is to help others that might want to buy the same equipment (although it’s a bit outdated in these days of multinational companies). You should try to get all of the model numbers of equipment as you do the work, so that you are not scrambling, later on, to find out what they were. It’s really quick and easy to take a picture of this at the time. If you have built or designed new equipment for your Materials and Methods, you can expect to make a diagram of this here, if it can’t be adequately described in a paragraph. 47.7 Data analysis This section is getting increasingly longer as people do ever more intricate statistical manipulations. As above, it’s very important that you use the same names for the variables as you have introduced and collected them. In addition to explaining the specific tests that you performed, you should explain what roles the variables have as dependent, independent, or random variables in your model. The independent variable has variation that does not depend on that of any other measure. These are usually measured by you during the experiment. The dependent variable is usually the one that you are testing to see whether any of the independent variables explain it. Random variables are subject to variations outside of your experimental control but that you want to make sure do not influence your interpretation of the dependent variable. Examples of random variables might be the order in which you did the experiment, or the position in your experimental setup). You should be familiar with the terms above from when you formulated your hypothesis (see Part II for a refresher). Any transformation of any of the data that you collected (e.g. log, ln, cosine) should be mentioned here, along with tests that you performed to ensure that they adhere to the conditions required for the statistical test that you conducted. Give the name for each package in R that you use, together with its citation. Some journals will have particular software conventions that you need to respect and adhere to. Also, give a citation to R as well as the version that you used in your analysis. If you don’t use the latest version of R, then your reviewers may want to know why, so always remember to update your version of R when you do your analysis. 47.8 Did you leave anything out? By following your Materials and Methods, anyone else should be able to repeat your work. If there isn’t enough detail for someone else to conduct the same experiment or survey, then you will need to add this information somewhere. For example, a list of sampling points or a database of sequences might be needed in Supplementary Information. The Materials and Methods section can often get overly long, and is relatively easy to edit to make it much shorter. In journals where there is a word count limit, you may want to move some of the Materials and Methods into a supplementation information section. But in your thesis, try to keep the Materials and Methods section as detailed as you can. 47.8.1 Be careful when editing The order in which you describe your Materials and Methods is important as it states what happened first and what subsequently. This often means that you rely on setting up the subject of a sentence and then referring to this antecedent thereafter. When you are editing, it is all too easy to get these sentences and their subjects muddled up. See the section on antecedents for clarity on this. "],["results.html", "Chapter 48 The Results 48.1 Description of your data 48.2 Responding to your hypotheses 48.3 When to have a table or graph? 48.4 Responding to hypotheses 48.5 Common mistakes", " Chapter 48 The Results This is perhaps the easiest section of your chapter or manuscript to write. However, there are still many mistakes that are made. Here, I will start with the approach that you should take, and then go through some of the common mistakes. 48.1 Description of your data Some studies have a set of descriptive results that, by convention, are placed without a section header at the start of the results. These normally convey the size of the dataset that entered into the rest of the analyses. If the size of the dataset varies by design in the methods, then you don’t need it here. But you can’t always control the sample size, so it needs to be established before moving on to the rest of the results. It may be that your methods do not always produce predictable results. In genetic studies, for example, this might include the number of samples that were collected and successfully sequenced, and thus entered into the rest of the analyses. Whenever you provide a summary of a variable (e.g. the mean), remember to include the variance; the range, standard deviation, or standard error in brackets following the mean. If you collected a lot of variables, it may be more relevant to have them summarised in a table. Once you have described the result, either make reference to the Table, Figure or Supplementary Information where this can be seen. If your tests are already in a table, then they should not be repeated in your text. Instead, simply make a summary statement asserting the results and add “(see Table 1)”. It is important to include mention of how much data was missing compared to your aim in the Material and Methods section. For example, an entire replicate may have been compromised, or a collection date might have been skipped for logistical reasons. If you are not testing an explicit hypothesis your results will concentrate on the description of your data, and your analysis of the pertinent information that it contains. This may be done through tables, figures or models. If you modelled your data, you will need to show all models tested either in a table in the results, or in the Supplementary Information. You will also likely need to describe how you selected the best model and describe it. Although it is correct to describe your model here, do not try to interpret your findings. This is done in the discussion. 48.2 Responding to your hypotheses The easiest way to write the results is simply to have the questions or hypotheses that you posed at the end of the introduction and use them as subheadings for your results section (Figure 48.1). Once you have these subheadings, you simply assemble all of the results that address that hypothesis. You should already have all the tests that you used in the Material and Methods section. No additional tests should be listed in the results if they were not already described in the Material and Methods section. FIGURE 48.1: You may well find that your results section is the shortest section of your manuscript. Only report what you need to in this section. Keep results that don’t respond to your hypotheses for the Supplementary Information. Remember that the most important aspect to your results is the size of any effect that you find and the confidence intervals, and not whether or not it is significant (Dushoff, Kain &amp; Bolker, 2019). This is not to say that significance should not be reported, this is important, and care should be taken to report the significance in a non-binary fashion (Dushoff, Kain &amp; Bolker, 2019; Muff et al., 2021) - see below. The results section often includes a lot of statistical testing, resulting in lots of numbers inside brackets within the text. This is all expected and fine, but consider consolidating multiple iterations into a table (if appropriate). When describing the relationship between two variables, make sure that you state the direction of the effect. This means not simply stating that they have a statistical relationship, but what that relationship is. For example, explaining that one increases with the other (a direct relationship), or one increases when the other decreases (an inverse relationship). Note that other types of variable relationships exist. When describing this relationship, you should also include the effect size (how much the relationship differs from no relationship), and the power of your test (usually the number of replicates that allows you to avoid a Type II error). 48.2.1 Moving away from binary significance Traditionally, we would say that only if P is less than α (alpha is usually 0.05) should you use the word ‘significant’ when describing the effect. However, the statistical community (including the biological community) is waking up to the need to replace the idea of the binary reporting of significance (“significant” or “not significant”), with wording that better reflects the reality of statistical testing ” (see Muff et al., 2021). The reason for this is that it represents a misunderstanding of statistical testing, and can be very misleading to those that read the results. Instead, we must appreciate that the position of our estimate of the P statistic lies somewhere along a continuum of potential results, and should be reported as such. The suggested change in language can be simply implemented as shown in Figure 48.1. FIGURE 48.2: Help your reader to better interpret the meaning of your statistical testing by changing your language. The figure shows some suggested language to use when writing about your results depending on the value of P that you find. These words should replace the binary outcome “significant” or “not significant” (see Muff et al., 2021). While this approach succeeds in getting away from the significance dichotomy, there are still dissenting voices with the concept of P values representing continuous measures of evidence (Goodman &amp; Royall, 1988). Another approach is to talk about the results of your significance tests in terms of the clarity that they provide about the relationship between the variables measured (Dushoff, Kain &amp; Bolker, 2019): whether they show a “statistically clear relationship” (aka significant), or “statistically unclear” (aka insigificant) (see Dushoff, Kain &amp; Bolker, 2019 for examples). Here, I stress that if you have a lower value for P (e.g. equating to strong evidence) you haven’t provided any additional evidence, you simply have more confidence in the non-compatibility of your data with your null hypothesis (H0). Your result is confined to the dataset that you are presenting. If you want additional evidence, then you need to run replicate experiments. Or, better still, find another mechanism in the biological sciences through which you can measure or test the same relationship. There are better alternatives when it comes to statistical testing, but getting the inferential wording correct may still represent a challenge for non-statisticians. If you have a statistical test with a P value, you do have to insert the results into the text, include the test statistic, degrees of freedom (which incorporates N - the sample size) and the value of P. My suggestion is that you also consider exactly what you can say about your result, the effect size, confidence intervals and inferred relationship between the variables, as well as any statistical significance. 48.3 When to have a table or graph? Most journals will allow you to have as many tables or graphs as you need to give your results. There are a few important things to consider. First, that data shouldn’t be repeated. So don’t have a table of results where the same results are also in a graph (or even two graphs that show the same data). Also, don’t repeat data from a figure or table in your text. You need to decide how best to present your data. If you can’t decide then discuss it with your advisor by presenting them with the alternatives. Good results should convey your findings clearly, and consulting with others should quickly help you decide which approach is effective. See sections on tables and figures below. 48.4 Responding to hypotheses While I encourage you to present data that corresponds to hypotheses here in the results section, you should not formally accept or reject your hypothesis in the results. This is done in the discussion, and allows you to present caveats and other important issues. 48.5 Common mistakes Having extra analyses in the results that you didn’t include in your methods. If you really didn’t anticipate conducting the extra tests, then these are actually post hoc (after the event) tests (not anticipated before the study) and you should think carefully about how to treat these. Otherwise, you’ll need to rejig your methods to make sure that all tests are included. Meaningless precision. This can happen throughout a thesis or manuscript (e.g. in the Materials and Methods), but it is most common in the results when too many significant figures are reported. For example, the output of your analysis might tell you that flight feathers in one population are 2.6484332 mm longer than those of another (± 0.0654562 mm), but in your methods you only use callipers that have a precision of 0.01 mm. Reporting results beyond the precision whereby they can be measured becomes meaningless. Whenever you obtain the output of a statistical package, you need to make sure that you use your practical head to re-interpret these results and think about what they actually mean. Repeating numbers in the text that are already in tables or graphs. The text is likely to be packed with numbers already, so don’t repeat any that are already represented elsewhere. Repeating text in different sections. As you’ve seen elsewhere in this book, repeating text simply isn’t acceptable. It doesn’t matter if you did the same thing many times, you can always write something in a different way. Having repeated text is the fastest way to bore the pants off your reader, and therefore must be avoided at all costs. References Dushoff J, Kain MP, Bolker BM. 2019.

This is because for the discussion you must already know all of the rest of the manuscript, starting with the hypothesis, which dictates what will go into all of the other sections. While writing the other sections, I often make notes under the heading ‘discussion’ so that it acts as an aide memoire to ideas that I’ve had during the study. Before you start writing your discussion, make a plan and then discuss this plan with your advisor. I’d make this suggestion for all of the sections of your chapter or paper. It doesn’t take that long to do, and it provides an opportunity for you and your advisor to talk about the results of your work and discuss them together. Such discussions should be eye opening for both of you, and they provide a great opportunity for you and your advisor to get excited about the work you’ve done, your results and what they mean. I get a lot of enjoyment during these discussions, especially when sharing the excitement of the results. Sharing thoughts before you start writing is important because by talking about it, you and your advisor are more likely to come to a consensus about the best way in which to interpret your results. Conversely, presenting them with the discussion finished might not be the best way of pitching your ideas. There is a convention that you do not refer to the tables or figures in the discussion. This is because they have already been referred to in the results, and a reader should have already consulted them there. Occasionally, you may want to have a new conceptual diagram in the discussion, but this is rare. Most often, you do not refer to figures or tables and no new ones appear in the discussion. In general, the first and last paragraphs of the discussion are key to the reader, but the discussion must also consider caveats and limitations in the experimental design and interpretation of your results, as well as providing a concise discussion of the results in the context of existing literature (Figure 49.1). This is also your opportunity to suggest new hypotheses and how they could be tested. FIGURE 49.1: Your discussion needs structure too. Let’s remember that if you are struggling to write, there is the potential to follow a formula, such as the one I outlined previously. I’d like to repeat that the convention described above is a formula that is intended to help you getting started with writing. It is not the only way to write, and if you feel confident that another way is better then I encourage you to explore this with the support of your advisor. Be imaginative and don’t feel that you are constrained or compelled to do anything in a formulaic way. 49.1 First paragraph of the discussion Your discussion begins by you responding to your hypothesis, clearly stating whether or not you accept it, and putting this into the wider context of the study (i.e. paragraph one or two of the introduction with relevant literature). You can then follow these statements by emphasising what you consider to be the most important finding, and explain how it adds to existing knowledge. However, don’t be tempted to over-interpret your results, or claim that they mean more than they do (see section on speculation below). This first paragraph of the discussion doesn’t have to be very long (three to four sentences), but you should make sure that you end by providing a link to the following paragraph or explaining how you will move the discussion on in sections. 49.2 To sub-section or not to sub-section the discussion? My preference is to plan the discussion before you write it, just as you did for the introduction using a bullet-pointed list. This will provide you with logical sub-section headers for the discussion under which you can write the first draft. When your chapter has a simple aim that is easily communicated, I’d suggest deleting these sub-section headings before you finish. However, many studies are more complex and contain multiple experiments or evidential approaches. It is then sometimes wise to leave sub-sections in your discussion so that your reader can more easily follow the text. Where possible, these should be the same sub-sections that you have broken your methods and results into, especially where these relate to specific hypotheses or aims. Or it may be more appropriate to discuss the different approaches separately, specifically when the literature that you refer to falls into different groups. If you are stuck and can’t decide which way is most appropriate for your work, spend more time on fleshing the outline specifically to include the literature that you want to cite. Try it one way, and then the other, and you should quickly be able to tell which makes more sense. Of course, you should also ask your advisor for their opinion – that’s what they are there for, after all. When considering what sub-section to write first, go back to the order that you’ve presented the questions or approaches in the rest of your chapter or manuscript. Keeping the order consistent throughout is a really good way of helping your reader follow what you want to communicate. Shuffling the order in each section is almost guaranteed to get them lost and wishing that they hadn’t started reading. Next you need to discuss! The discussion is about explaining the meaning of your results to the reader. I often find that people write a lot of inappropriate information in the discussion. Remember that this section is not going to provide background information, and is unlikely to bring up new topics that need introducing. It may be that your results prompt you to introduce a new area of research that wasn’t covered in your introduction, and this is fine. But for the main part, you should discuss your results in the context of existing literature. You can expect that the literature that you use in your discussion will only partially overlap with your introduction, with plenty of new citations. Similarly, it can be that discussing your results will mean that you end up with paragraphs that have no citations. In order to provide a critical evaluation of your research findings, you really need to present a reasoned argument (Jenicek, 2006). In some respects, when writing the discussion your walk a tightrope between inferring the meaning of your results for a wider audience, and making claims that are too broad (Table 49.1). Overreaching in the discussion (and consequently abstract) is a common problem that examiners and reviewers regularly ask authors pull back on their claims. When providing different sides of an argument, try to use your results to conclude that one side is supported more than the other. If your results don’t help with this particular point, then it could be that you are trying to discuss something that isn’t directly related to the work. This is a very common problem in discussions, and a good test is asking yourself how your results add to the point you are trying to discuss. If they don’t leave it out and move on. TABLE 49.1: Some discussion dos and don’ts (adapted from Jenicek 2006). Balance your discussion so that you provide a reasoned argument that reflects what you found. Do Don’t Provide a summary of your major findings Use statements that are too broad Interpret your results with respect to mechanisms Over-represent your results Give problems with methods and techniques Provide unrealistic solutions to deficiencies Compare similarities and contrasts with other studies Ignore conflicting literature Provide practical implications of your results Be unrealistic about what could be done Give directions for future research Simply state what you have done elsewhere in your thesis Restrain your conclusions to evidence from your data Make unsubstantiated claims that overreach your evidence Provide insight into unresolved questions, controversies and biases Reductio ad absurdum Explain the study design’s limitations and uncertainties Inflate the importance of your findings Highlight the strengths of your study Forget to mention the limitations Provide alternative interpretations and hypotheses Go into tangential issues Give unexpected results and anomalies Avoid being critical of how your study could have produced unexpected results Mention literature that contradicts your findings Use your conclusions as a ‘bully pulpit’ Provide arguments that are logical and coherent Erect a ‘straw man’ or ‘false dichotomy’ Make conclusions based on your logic Make emotional appeals to the reader Make sure that you’ve discussed all results Suddenly introduce new data or results not previously presented Boast about your findings Apologise or undermine your own work Be concise Waffle on Take a look at target journal requirements and suggestions for a discussion Feel that journal advice is not relevant to you 49.3 Caveats and limitations An important aspect of the discussion is to consider how the interpretation of your results may be incorrect. For example, if you have done an experiment, how well controlled was it and how well could it be considered to scale up to real-world interactions? Could you have measured other variables? Almost every study will have caveats and limitations, and it is very important that you report them in a considered approach. You can also add ideas on how to improve your approach to eliminate important caveats that you have identified, even if this means suggesting something that adds evidence from a completely different field of biology. My preference is not to provide all the caveats and limitations as a separate paragraph. Instead, mention them when you are discussing relevant aspects. 49.4 Should you speculate in the discussion? Reviewers will often be unhappy with speculation in the discussion section. Speculation isn’t that hard to spot, as it occurs when you make claims for which your results have no foundation. I think that it is healthy to have one or two statements that are speculative, but clearly label them as such. After all, after writing this paper, you are going to be one of the world experts in the topic, and thus your deeper understanding is often worth relating to the reader. However, I suggest that you speculate in combination with suggesting what work could be done in future. Remember, if you really feel that the point has to be made, you must clearly label it as speculative. Perhaps an easier trap to fall into is over-interpretation. This is when you suggest that your results mean more than they do. It’s an easy trap to fall into, especially after setting up the study in relation to key topics in the discipline (presented in paragraph one or two of the introduction). You will probably find it hard to see where you have over-interpreted, and this is something that having your work read by your advisor, or another colleague, will really help. You may then be asked to ‘tone down’ your claim, or to place it into the direct findings of your results. Again, my preference is not to place all speculations or future hypotheses in the same paragraph of the discussion. These aspects should appear as the topics they relate to are discussed. 49.5 Don’t beat up on others Your results may show that other researchers were wrong with their interpretation or findings. Whatever you may think of them, never use your discussion to be disrespectful to other researchers or their work. This has been referred to as the ‘bully pulpit’ or an ad hominem attack. As with all aspects of professional interactions, consider how you would like to be treated, and act accordingly. This is not to say that you shouldn’t point out mistakes that were made before, but be sure not to be emotive or insulting. Things brings to mind Freud’s narcissism of minor differences, in which he pointed out that bitter fights could start between groups when they, in fact, agree on 90% on issues. So it is likely to be true that someone you might disagree with one one point, is likely to be allied with you on nearly all of their other views and opinions. Making and maintaining allegiances is more likely to get you in a position where you can constructively discuss any minor disagreements. Consider this before you are tempted to launch a negative sounding social media post. Generally, such comments won’t get through the peer review process, and remember that you might be insulting the examiner of your thesis (or the reviewer of your paper) – which is not likely to go down well! 49.6 Where next? The ‘where next’ aspect of your discussion is important as it may provide the reader with ideas for their own work. Of course, these are questions that you may wish to pursue in your own career, or they may require corroborating evidence from other disciplines that you will never undertake. Either way, making pointers for continuing aspects of the research is an important component of the discussion. Providing new lines of research may also allow you to speculate about what you consider to be the most important angle of this topic now that you have presented your results. This should be justifiable and not gratuitous. There’s no point in suggesting what other studies could be done just for the sake of it, or just because you happen to have already done them in your thesis. But if there are legitimate parts of your thesis that link to your discussion of your chapter (and this is quite likely), then you should definitely point to them. 49.7 Last paragraph The last paragraph of the discussion is your take-home message. It’s a summary paragraph that sets out what you aimed to achieve, and what the new state of understanding of the topic is now that your results are out. This should include the key literature that can now be reconsidered. 49.7.1 Never repeat text Please remember that while this might sound similar to your first paragraph, it is not the same. This final paragraph should not replicate any text that appears elsewhere in your chapter or manuscript (not even the abstract). Never repeat or copy text generally, even within your own chapter (or between chapters). For the reader, it’s very easy to spot and it gives the impression that you have nothing to say and are simply filling space. This is not the kind of impression that you want to give your reader, especially if they are examining your work! As always, there are a number of other places to look for more advice to write your discussion, and I’d encourage you to read as widely as possible. For example, try Hess (2004), Jenicek (2006) and Şanlı (2013). Still struggling with your discussion?

It is easy to forget people and so it is worth considering making notes about who has helped you along the entire time with your PhD. Then all you have to do is remember where you wrote it down! 50.1 Thank your funders You should thank any people or organisations that funded you or any component of your work. Check with them they may have specific wording that they want you to use. Remember that your institution may not have given you money but may have supported you in other ways, and you should probably thank them. There are registers of funders, and you should use these to see whether your funder is present and exactly how they should be acknowledged. One example is the Crossref Funder Registry. Funders rely on being able to search databases for their name and find all of the work that they have funded. This means that you should use the particular wording that they supplied, especially if they specify this in their funding letter. If your funders aren’t in the database, you might suggest that they get added. 50.2 People and organisations to thank Try to remember all of those people who helped you doing fieldwork, or in the laboratory. Especially laboratory technicians (if they are not also authors) without whom a lot of the work that we do isn’t possible. People that may have helped administer your funds or other office administration. Organisations that gave you permission to do your work. In some journals, the acknowledgements are the correct place to put your permit numbers along with the names of the organisations who provided them. Increasingly, permission from ethics committees is placed in the materials and methods but do check with the journal instructions to authors. People who supplied you with samples, images or other elements of your work or presentation of your manuscript. Many journals have specific ways in which they want people’s names to be written. You will need to follow the guidelines. For example, authors are often referred to by their initials in the acknowledgements. This is useful when some people in your paper need to thank particular funding bodies who didn’t fund others. Thank anyone who gave you a photograph that you used in the paper. 50.3 Who not to thank (in your manuscript acknowledgements) You do not need to thank anyone who is an author. The exception is in your thesis acknowledgements, where you should mention them and their support. Personally, I tend not to thank people who were paid to do a specific job and only did that job. The acknowledgements is a section to name people who have gone out of their way to help you. Your family for getting you to grad school (unless they really helped you do the work). However, in your thesis acknowledgements, you should absolutely include your family. If in doubt, it’s probably a good idea to be as inclusive as you can in the acknowledgements. If in doubt with the acknowledgements refer to other acknowledgement sections in the same journal and see how they are formatted and written. Remember that if your journal is conducting double-blind review, they may ask for the acknowledgements (and the title page) to be removed from the main manuscript and uploaded separately. "],["references.html", "Chapter 51 The References 51.1 Vancouver style 51.2 Harvard style 51.3 Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)", " Chapter 51 The References Having the references at the end of your chapter or publication is actually very important because in-text citations often are not sufficient to determine exactly which paper you are referring to. Once you become very familiar with your own specific field you will find that you do glance at the references to make sure that the authors are citing the papers you think they are. It’s also a great place to learn about literature that you don’t know about already, and for this, you need the full citation in order to look up the paper. The right time to make sure that references are in the document is when you are writing the document. Do not leave this until the end. It has happened to me many times that I have written an in-text citation, did not paste the citation at the end of the document, and by the time I had finished writing, had forgotten what I had read and where I had read it. This then leads to a lot more time wasting trying to find that or another relevant citation. Earlier in this book, I provided a guide to the differences between Vancouver and Harvard referencing styles. Here I provide the output for the references that were given in that section to demonstrate the way in which these different referencing styles take up very different amounts of space.

Be aware that these styles (Vancouver and Harvard) represent two broad approaches, every publisher has their own variation on these, and that they can vary substantially between different journals. Full details are always provided by the journal (in their Instructions to Authors), and you can refer to these to see how your references need to be formatted. I also provide some pointers towards using reference managers. These can save you a lot of time, if you’ve already invested time in setting them up. Alternatively, they can be very frustrating. Lots of journals (or perhap’s it’s their editors) are very fussy about the way that citations are given in their publications. If you have used a decent reference manager then you won’t care, and it’ll just be a case of finding the appropriate format from their repository (or making it yourself). There are lots of better things that you could be doing with your time instead of formatting references. And so I’m not going to spend a long time here telling you that you must do it right. I really believe that on first submission of your manuscript you should be able to submit your references in any format. it really only makes sense for you to do all the work formatting them if you aren’t going to pay to publish the paper. An increasing number of journals do allow you to use any referencing style (within the generic Vancouver or Harvard format) when you first submit. You are only then required to format them if your ms is likely to be accepted. There are lots of anal academics out there who will delight in looking for every missing full-stop, comma and capital letter missing from your references. Perhaps it’s because they feel secure pointing out these errors, but are incapable of knowing whether or not you’ve written good or bad science. Please don’t join them and, if you can, look for a better world where you spend your valuable time doing more important things. 51.3 Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) A DOI is an international standard (ISO) unique character string to identify physical, digital or abstract objects. Their beauty is that they are persistent over time, so once issued they will always be a way to reach a particular object. DOIs are extremely useful as you can usually click on an active link DOI and go straight to the article in question. Therefore it is well worth adding the DOI to your references if you can. Some journals will allow this (and even demand it), while others have yet to come around to how useful they are. However, DOIs cannot replace references, otherwise, we’d need to be able to click on every link all the time, and couldn’t read any paper without a connection to the internet. It’s still really useful to be able to read a formatted reference at the end of a paper. 51.3.1 DOI tools If you are writing your references by hand and need a DOI for every reference then there is this very useful online software that will provide the DOI if there is one for every reference you enter: doi.crossref.org There’s an equally useful database that provides BibTex for DOIs that you enter: doi2bib.org "],["tables.html", "Chapter 52 Tables", " Chapter 52 Tables If you think that tables are just about displaying a series of boring numbers, then it’s time to free your mind. Tables are an amazing vehicle to display information that can be numeric, written or pictorial. From the simplest of two by two tables with several levels of organisation, the reason for putting your information in a table is that you can provide it in a simpler and easier way to the reader than if you were to put all the information in full into a paragraph of text. There are few rules on Tables, but you’ll find some guidelines in this Table 52.1. Most journals want tables formatted so that there are only horizontal lines. This makes them easier to print, but it can make following text across a large table difficult. Shading every other row really helps with this, and if you have the option of using this in your thesis then I’d recommend it. As a biologist, I first started to use tables to provide large quantities of numbers. Tables of morphological measurements or meristics (counts). These were always tricky to put together in word processors, until they became better integrated with spreadsheets, and now it’s really easy to put these tables together and even format them in a spreadsheet and then cut and paste them into your word processor. TABLE 52.1: Some general dos and don’ts for tables. There are exceptions for all of these, but if you can stick to them you are unlikely to go far wrong. Do Don’t Use a table as a means of reducing the length of your text. Merge cells, especially in irregular ways, as this makes formatting and copy/paste of your table prone to errors. Make your headings clear and concise. Omit units of measurement Summarise extensive data. Try to include every data point (that’s what Supp Info is for). Use tables to provide repeated statistical information on tests or models. Feel the need to include all of these in the ms (that’s what Supp Info is for). Provide a full table legend that explains exactly what is in it (see figures). Make tables so large that they have to run over several pages. If this can go into Supp Info then it should. Be adventurous by using tables to produces ideas, even with entire paragraphs of text or photographs. Feel obliged to stick to using tables only for numbers. Use shading for every other row. Have rows or columns so close together that you can’t tell them apart. "],["figures.html", "Chapter 53 Figures 53.1 Graphs 53.2 Maps 53.3 Conceptual diagram 53.4 The composite figure 53.5 Sending your graphics file to the publisher 53.6 The figure legend", " Chapter 53 Figures The way in which to visualise your data requires another book on the topic, as there are a myriad of decisions to make on all sorts of topics. What I provide below is a very brief start to thinking about these topics. If you need to explore more of the world of data visualisation, I suggest that you read books on this topic. Happily, people like Kieran Healy (2018), Jack Dougherty and Ilya Ilyankou (2021) and Claus Wilke (2019) have each written such books. Claus points out that while there are ways in which you can go wrong when plotting data (such as drawing lines to infer relationships that are not there), the skills in data visualisation are more in the aesthetic and interpretive environment of what tools to use that make the data easiest to interpret. How will the figure enhance understanding of the data and respond to your hypotheses? Note that the principal software used for drawing data in Dougherty &amp; Ilyankou’s, Kieran’s and Claus’s books is R (see part 1), and the many packages that have been developed for use within the R environment (R Core Team, 2024). The distinct advantages that this produces are the almost limitless additions and details that you can make to these figures to produce exactly what you want, in a vector format. The drawback is that you might need to invest some time to learn how the graphics package works, and how to manipulate it to do what you want. I agree with the approach of Dougherty and Ilyankou (2021) who suggest that you start any figure by mapping out what you want to convey and how. Sketch this out and discuss it with your advisor. 53.1 Graphs You should be aware of all the things that make up a good graph already. Here I’m going to provide some extra pointers on what I think is important and should be considered when drawing a good graph: Labels. This seems completely obvious and yet it is a common problem with submitted papers. Axes should be labelled with both an explanation and the units in which they were measured. Capitals. Be consistent in capitalising labels and other words in your figure. Avoid using just capitals (e.g. ALL CAPITALS ARE DIFFICULT TO READ AND UNSIGHTLY) The scale. Make sure that the numbers of the scale are large enough to read even when the figure is reduced the size that it will be printed on the page. This includes the text that crossed the axes. If you have used a log scale, make sure that this is prominently labelled. Data points. I am a great fan of including all the data points that go to make up any summary statistic that is displayed on the graph. Thus, if you provide a mean or something like a box plot for your x-axis category, then please add all data points as well. This can be done using the jitter function in R. Don’t draw relationships that aren’t there. The ease of plotting graphs makes it possible to display relationships between data points that don’t exist. This is most commonly done across a set of discrete measurements when a continuous line links them without any data to suggest this relationship. Be especially careful when plotting lines that you can infer a continuous value between points plotted. Compiling graphs. If you have a series of graphs that share the same x- or y-axis then consider compiling them together. This essentially turns them into a composite figure, but it often means that readers can compare data easily from one graph to another. Remember that you will have to make sure that the scales on the shared access are all the same. Use consistent symbols and colours throughout your thesis. Your thesis will likely plot data on similar variables in many ways throughout. By using consistent symbols (e.g. circles for females and triangles for males) and colours throughout the thesis for the variables that chapters have in common, you will help your reader understand a figure much more quickly. The consistency of the graphical environment of a thesis will facilitate understanding. Consistency is especially important across panels within a composite figure. Colour. The reason for all the fuss about not having colour in figures is mostly to do with the extra cost involved in printing them. Typically these days, it is possible to use colour in figures and for these to be reproduced without any extra charge online. Thus if the data that you have is best shown with colour then use colour. There are some things to be mindful of when using colour. Colour blindness: This affects quite a large portion of the population, particularly men. To avoid using colours that can be easily confused simply look them up. Printing colour in monochrome: some people still like to print out papers in order to read them, annotate them or share them at a journal club. Using a monochrome printer many colours are indistinguishable. You can therefore change the hue or intensity of a colour to make sure that it can be distinguished when it is printed. Aesthetic quality: some colours don’t go well together. A lot of people have already determined this and you can find a good guide here. 53.2 Maps There are many reasons why you might need to include a map in your paper when writing for biological sciences. I find that the easiest way of creating Maps is to use GIS software like QGIS or ArcGIS. Both of these require a good degree of learning in order to master. To have a map with sampling points is relatively straight forward. Especially with QGIS you can watch ‘how to’ videos on the internet to learn most of what you need to know. Things to remember when you’re drawing a map: If your map is a detailed view of an area then consider a small context map in the corner showing where your area is Include the scale Provide a North arrow especially if you have rotated the view Some journals require a specific mention of the geographic projection see here, or to provide a citation for each layer of the map (which makes sense when you think about it). Thus it’s a good policy to make sure you know the provenance of the layers that you are using. When using colour see these handy sets of colours to use at Colorbrewer. Make sure that any points you have included are big enough so that you can see the point and the shape of a point when the figure is reduced Strictly speaking maps in figures should not have embedded legends (keys). The correct way to explain symbols is to do it in the figure legend. However, sometimes if there are many different symbols it is more expedient to use an embedded legend. 53.2.1 Maximising the content of your figure Sometimes you will have the option of including more information in a figure than the original plan that you started with. This is perhaps especially true when it comes to producing maps with GIS because you have the option of adding extra data layers. But remember that this information should not be gratuitous. In Figure 53.1, we can see a map that shows a number of sampling sites. The map has a scale bar and north arrow as needed. FIGURE 53.1: A plain map can give all the information needed. This map adequately shows the positions of sample sites (or anything else) as red points within the southern African region. However, it is relatively simple to add more information to this map in the form of layers. In Figure 53.2, a digital elevation model (DEM) allows us to see the relative elevation at the sampling points, while transparent colours provide information about the different biomes in which the samples were made. Lastly, I’ve used a piece of sea to insert an image of the species sampled. There is also a reference map (top left) showing the area of southern Africa where the sampling points occur. This figure is now much more informative, and has greater aesthetic appeal to me, but all of this added information is only of use if relevant to the manuscript or chapter. FIGURE 53.2: Maps tend to have a lot of space, and GIS provides the opportunity to add layers to give rich information, as well as improving aesthetics. This map shows lots more information about the biomes in which each of the sample sites (red dots) falls, the elevation and an image of the species sampled. The inset of Africa (top left) shows the area sampled with a red square. I’ve also managed to fit in an image of the species sampled into the sea (bottom right). 53.3 Conceptual diagram Conceptual diagrams or figures are very useful in the introduction or methods when you have undertaken a complex study design. There are many different ways of doing this, but essentially the information needs to be conveyed in a way that is more simple in the figure than writing it out. Boxes and arrows are sufficient for most purposes. If the figure gets too complicated to understand, it’s probably of little use. I encourage my students to draw conceptual diagrams of how the thesis chapters relate to one another (Figure 56.1), and then to include this diagram in the introduction to the thesis to help examiners and any other readers to understand how the chapters are interrelated (see Part IV). I suggest that it is also very useful when you’re undertaking a review to draw a conceptual diagram for yourself of what you were trying to achieve. This may or may not then be included in the review when it comes to publishing. In order to make your conceptual diagram clear the following points should be followed: Keep any text in the diagram large enough so that when it is reduced to printing size it can still be read Try not to write full sentences but just notes Make use of arrows to show how ideas are related Look at other conceptual diagrams, especially those that resonate with you as a reader 53.4 The composite figure For me, composite figures started when I noticed other papers were including small pictures of species in phylogenies. As a reader, I really liked this way of understanding more about the animals that were being studied. The composite figure also comes about by making use of blank spaces that naturally occur within figures. Many graphs have large white spaces toward the top (left or right), and small images of study animals, cartoons of study designs or systems can be inserted to improve the immediate recognition of what the figure is portraying. 53.4.1 Ideas for composite figures: Include a picture of the subject species in a small corner of blank space in one of your figures. For example, maps with a large area of sea (if your subject is a terrestrial species) are especially good for this (see Figure 53.2). 53.5 Sending your graphics file to the publisher One consistent problem is the lack of understanding that authors have for different file types. It can be rather confusing as these are stated in lots of different ways, and often in units that are not intuitive. Journals usually have long and detailed explanations of how to do this in their instructions to authors, yet this is one of the most common difficulties that authors have. I will provide a brief overview of the most common problems, but better overviews exist and I encourage you to read them (e.g. Wilke, 2019). Be aware that the publisher won’t be able to change anything within your figure, like the fonts. This means that you will need to use the same font in your figures as stipulated by the journal (in the instructions to authors). You also need to be critical of the size of any fonts that you use so that they can be seen even if the figure is reduced to fit the page width, or half page width. Be especially careful of numbers on scales as well as labels. Most publishers will require you to name the files of your figures to correspond with their instructions to authors. If they don’t have specific requirements, then use clear file names (e.g. Figure_1.png), and not cryptic ones. Remember that each figure needs a single file, so if you have produced a composite figure, then you will need to output this as a single graphics file. You will need to send them a generic file type (e.g. eps, jpg) and not something specific to the software that you used (e.g. ai, cdr). Colour is usually free to produce online, but you may need to pay for printed production. Make sure that your figure makes sense in monochrome if you intend the colour to be online only. 53.5.1 Vectors vs bitmaps The biggest difference among image types is the difference between vectors (a line drawn between two points) and bitmaps (using pixels to create images). Vector diagrams will produce superior images on screen that will allow you to zoom in without loss of resolution (e.g. svg, eps, pdf). With a bitmap, the more you zoom, the more you will be able to see the pixels that make up the figure. If at all possible, create your figures using vector graphics (such as in R or drawing software such as Adobe Illustrator), and store them in this format. The only exceptions will be images (e.g. png, jpg, tif, raw, gif, bmp) that you add to composite figures, insert these with the highest resolution available. If your figure is a photograph (or another tonal image type), then it will have to be a bitmap. However, if you have a line drawing, try to get it output as a vector rather than a bitmap as not only will the quality be better, but your options for editing and improving will be greater (should the editor require this). 53.5.2 Sizing your figure When you export your graphic from the graphics package that you are using to draw it, specify the resolution (most often in dpi: dots per inch) given by the publisher. Minimum resolution for photos and tone images is 400 dpi, and 600 dpi for line drawings. Remember that the dpi will change if the size of your figure changes. Hence you must know the printed size of your figure (in cm or inches) on the page. This is usually either one or two columns. Rarely, a journal might allow you to use landscape instead of portrait for a figure. As a rule, you should use the page setup in your package to specify the output size of your figure (page layout function) before you start, and then set the resolution before you export the figure. It’s always possible to draw at a higher resolution and convert to a lower resolution. Low-resolution images need to be redrawn to make them higher resolution. If you are using R, you can specify your graphical output in your coding. If you are using a GUI (like R Studio), you can choose to export as an image (i.e. bitmap) or pdf (i.e. vector). R Studio will allow you to set a generic or custom page size before you save. 53.6 The figure legend The most important point with the figure legend is that it should be a stand-alone explanation of what is in the figure. The reader should not have to refer to the text in order to understand what is in the figure. For example, if the figure is about a species then species name should be included in full. The explanation of any variables or categories needs to be provided. But it should not be taken to absurd levels, and is not a reason to repeat everything that’s in the materials and methods. Take a look at some figure legends that are already published in the journal that you are hoping to submit to and you should have a good idea of what to write. Figure legends need to be full, grammatically correct sentences. Remember that the figure legend is placed underneath the embedded figure in your thesis. This means that the graphic itself should not have any title. Traditional submissions to journals require figure legends to be at the end of the manuscript, before the figures themselves. Many journals now allow you to embed a lower resolution image of the figure on first submission together with the legend underneath in order to facilitate peer review. Check on the requirements for your institution or journal before finalising this. A trend with online journals is that each figure (and table) needs a topic or title sentence, followed by a description. This is a good way forward with any figure legend. Both need to be uploaded along with the image file when you submit the manuscript. References Dougherty J, Ilyankou I. 2021. Hands-On Data Visualization. O’Reilly Media, Inc. Healy K. 2018.

More and more journals are asking authors to supply information about who did what. This is an attempt to increase transparency and reduce the incidence of ghost authorship. There are a lot of politics around authorship. How do you decide whether or not someone did enough to be included on an author line. This is a very important point. All that I will say here is that this should have been decided early on in the study. Everyone should know whether or not they are going to be an author at the time that they participate. No one should ever find out but they were not an author by reading their name in the acknowledgements. 54.1 CRediT where it’s due After many iterations, there is now a widely recognised list of 14 different ways in which authors can contribute towards a study (Table 54.1). Even when the study is a chapter in your PhD thesis, it’s unlikely that you can put your name next to every role in the CRediT taxonomy. This does give you some realistic perspective about the collaborative nature of science. TABLE 54.1: There is now a recognised list of different ways in which authors contribute to publications. The CRediT taxonomy allows you to ascribe contributions from each of the authors into one or more of 14 different roles. Ways in which authors contribute to studies Conceptualisation Data curation Formal Analysis Funding acquisition Investigation Methodology Project administration Resources Software Supervision Validation Visualisation Writing – original draft Writing – review and editing If you want to know more about each of these roles and how they are defined in the CRediT taxonomy then please visit the site. You can also ‘claim’ these roles under your Rescognito profile, linked to your ORCID account. Even if the journal that you are submitting to does not use the credit taxonomy. I would suggest that you use this as the basis for your saying who did what in the publication. See a blog article on this here. Otherwise, you could end up with what is known as hyperauthorship, a phenomenon evidenced by massive co-authorship levels (Cronin, 2001). 54.2 Ordering the author line up In Biological Sciences, it is traditional for the author who did most of the work to take the first position. For you and your thesis you are most likely to be the first author, certainly for all of your thesis chapters. The last position is normally for the head of the laboratory in which the work was undertaken. This would usually be your advisor, but could be another collaborator, if, for example, you went to do some work in their laboratory. Funding also plays a role here, and if you are unsure about who should be listed last, then ask your advisor. In between the first and last authors is a bit of a no-man’s land. Some people order it by who did most (closest to first), but then there is also a push to be closest to last place (closest to being more senior). Alphabetical also works, but that often benefits or penalises those who have names that regularly appear higher up or lower down in the alphabet. One colleague is always first to suggest alphabetical order as he regularly ends up as last author. There is such a thing as shared first (and even last) authorship. You see these appearing with increasing regularity, marked with an asterisk or other symbol. Hence, there can be several top spots, and these should work just fine for your CV.

Being proud of your work is being proud of the entire product, including the data and the analysis. If you felt they were good enough for peer review, then you should be happy to make them all freely available. Not sure if you haven’t made some mistakes? We all make mistakes and you shouldn’t think that you will have an entirely fault-free career. Whenever and wherever possible conduct your professional due diligence and be open and honest with your research. Science is a career when we should openly acknowledge errors and mistakes that we have made in the past. There’s no problem with this. Indeed, the problems only start when you refuse to acknowledge past errors and mistakes, making you prone to motivated reasoning and confirmation bias. There are lots of data repositories out there. Some specialise in particular kinds of data, like genetic data in GenBank, or sound data in The Macaulay Library at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Others are general repositories of data and you can post anything there, including the scripts that you used to analyse the data. By doing this you ensure that any people that want to use your work in the future have full access to it. Your data deposit will be given a DOI. You can use this DOI in your publication so that readers know where to find the data. Once I happily allowed the publishers to store my data. These days, I simply don’t trust them to curate and keep my data for posterity. The way that most publishers of academic journals behave, there is no reason for them to make sure that my data is safe and secure. Therefore, I would rather go to an independent curator of data that specialises in not-for-profit data curation. One example is Zenodo which is built and operated by CERN and OpenAIRE. This site has the advantage that it is integrated with GitHub (if you are already a user, but check it out if you aren’t). You can choose to open your data immediately, or embargo it until your paper is published. It’s a great platform, and so much more secure than using a publisher. Another example is the Open Science Framework (OSF) that aims to be a one-stop shop for all of your storage needs. You will need to make sure that your data is correctly sorted with sufficient metadata for someone else to understand (see Roche et al., 2015). Once, we did statistical analysis with a GUI and a point and click approach. Forget to click a checkbox and the results were not repeatable. As the analyses have become increasingly sophisticated with more and differing pieces of software, it is becoming increasingly important to record the code that you write that gets your results together with your data. This is the difference between making your results and, therefore, your study repeatable. Talk to your advisor. Your lab or your institution may have a repository that they prefer. 55.3 Why stop with just depositing your data and analyses online? Let’s face it, you probably put a lot of effort into proposing your thesis hypotheses. Why not deposit this too? Remember that it does not have to be accessible to the world, but it would improve the integrity of your study if your original hypotheses are the same as the ones that you submit for publication. Some journals are now asking whether you have stored hypotheses ahead of conducting the experiments. They don’t stop you from submitting if you haven’t. But why not? It’s a great step forward in terms of transparency and provides more credibility when you eventually write that manuscript with the same aims. And it shouldn’t stop you from publishing another study that happened along the way, even though you hadn’t planned it. I suspect that in future funders will require us to deposit our successful funding proposals in an online repository before they release funds - hopefully, they’ll also be willing to support these facilities financially.

When you look at PhDs that are stored in your institution’s libraries, or those that you’ve referred to in the course of your study, you will notice that they have two additional chapters in addition to data chapters. These are often quite short (although lengths vary), and serve to introduce and conclude the PhD thesis (Figure 56.1. While these are not usually considered to be the ‘meat’ of the PhD itself, they are important sections to reflect on and carefully consider, as they attempt to pull together data chapters that are written as stand-alone documents into a cohesive thesis. To this end, they require the same careful planning that any other section in your thesis deserves, with one important condition: that they should not impede the timely submission of your thesis.

The exact construction of your thesis may vary, especially with the number of data chapters that you have. The relationship between thesis chapters may also not be linear as presented here.

The exact construction of your thesis may vary, especially with the number of data chapters that you have. The relationship between thesis chapters may also not be linear as presented here. At this point, we have to acknowledge that different institutions require different deadlines of their students in order to finish their PhD studies and submit their theses for examination. In most institutions (to my knowledge) the time to submission is the most important, and can vary between 3 and 5 years (most institutions stipulate a minimum period of 2 years and some have no maximum duration). This period is critical with respect to funding. If funding ceases and your institution allows you to continue your studies, you may have to raise the funding to pay fees as well as to maintain your living costs. After submission, there will be a period of time while your thesis is in examination, and another period before the final graduation. Each of these milestones comes with its own set of deadlines and conditions. It is well worth being aware of all these issues well in advance of any submission deadline (ask your advisor). Important aspects for you to note are whether or not you need to remain registered at your institution after you have submitted your thesis, and whether or not your institution will require payment for your registration. Whatever your deadlines are will dictate how much time (and energy) you have to devote to the opening and closing chapters of your thesis. They can become publishable in their own right, or at the bare minimum, they can serve to allow you to submit a completed thesis. Here I will focus on the latter, minimum requirement (in my eyes), with the understanding that you should dedicate as much time as you have available to produce a quality product that you can feel proud of. The next chapters deal with writing the introductory chapter, the concluding chapter, and then finally formatting your thesis for submission. These final hurdles require some time and thought. Given that not all of you will have all of the time that you need, this is often the time when the demand on your writing skills reaches a peak. If you are in this position, I urge you to use your time wisely and to plan carefully what you will write. "],["PhDintro.html", "Chapter 57 How to introduce your PhD chapters 57.1 How long should the introductory chapter be?", " Chapter 57 How to introduce your PhD chapters For each of your data chapters, you will have already written an introduction section, and the same principles that you used to construct this will apply here. Instead of aiming to introduce any one of the hypotheses in the chapters, however, your introduction will aim to introduce the ideas and concepts explored inside the data chapters of the thesis. My suggestion would be for you to start with the conceptual diagram of the thesis that you produced in your proposal. If you didn’t construct one then, you may be reluctant to do it now, but having a good conceptual idea of how the components of your thesis fit together will really aid you in putting together both this introduction and the final conclusion. For your proposal, you may also have written a general introduction, and it would be worth revisiting this now, even if you don’t actually use any of it. Using your conceptual diagram of your thesis, my suggestion is that you formalise this into a figure that you can present in the introductory chapter. Even if it’s a very simple concept (like Figure 35.1), it will help your examiners (and any other readers) understand what to expect in your chapters and how they are interrelated. Next, produce a hierarchy of hypotheses for all of the chapters and concepts in your thesis (see Figure 16.2). This will help you to make sure that you cover all of the big ideas and concepts in the outline. Your outline should follow the standard funnel formula (see Figure 46.2) this time with the highest level ideas in your hierarchy of hypotheses given full prominence in the first paragraph. Although it’s tempting, I’d urge you not to copy any text from any of the introductions in any of your chapters. By all means, draw upon their contents and references therein to give you inspiration, but this introductory chapter can’t be a cut and paste job (Figure 32.1). The reason being that your examiners will spot this straight away, and it won’t put your work in the best light. As before, if you can produce an outline of what you need to say in your introductory chapter, you should be well practised enough (by now) to write original text that will do the job of introducing all of the chapters. 57.0.1 Citing your chapters Your aim in this introduction is to introduce all of the chapters in your thesis, thus you will to cite them. My suggestion would be that you leave these citations to the final paragraphs (or subsection) of the introduction, and not have a structure that centres around introducing each chapter as a paragraph. Remember that you may well have this (in the form of abstracts) throughout the thesis, so it would be redundant to do that here. Instead, try to introduce chapters by concentrating on their themes and/or contributions to the bigger ideas that you address in your work. The way in which to cite your chapters is most straightforward here by using their chapter number (i.e. Chapter n). This will make it obvious to the examiner (or any other reader) that it is within the content of the thesis. If chapters are published, you could add a citation to the paper in addition, but not instead of. 57.0.2 Formulate the objectives of your study? At this point in your thesis writing, it is worth looking back to the criteria used to judge a PhD at your institution. Yours may differ from those stated in this book, but it is clear that you should be able to formulate the objectives of your study, and that this includes not only the objectives of the individual data chapters, but of the study overall (here in the introductory chapter). By the end of the introductory chapter, anyone reading should know what the thesis is about, and what it is that you aim to find out. This doesn’t mean that they know what you found in each of the data chapters, but that they know the topics explored within the thesis and what was done to address them. 57.0.3 Review consistent thesis themes If your thesis has a study organism, experimental approach, or environmental system, then it would be appropriate to provide a reasonably comprehensive review of this in the introduction. The aim of this would be to explain why this theme was chosen. The extent of the review would depend entirely on how much time and energy you have to devote to this. Ideally, you would aim for your first chapter to be a review of the literature in your study area, with the last section of the review rationalising the need for the particular approach that you have taken to address unexplored areas. However, as stated above, it may well be that you don’t have the time to write a comprehensive review for your introductory chapter. If you do, then the most important aspect will be what to cover in the review (exactly what portion of the literature), and whether and how you want to publish it. Publications of reviews broadly fall into traditional reviews and systematic reviews (including meta-analyses). The latter require considerable amount of time and effort, and systematic reviews (i.e. those in which you assess an unbiased slice of literature on a topic) might be the only way to publish a review in some journals or subdisciplines. Although the review of consistent themes could be anything from two pages to an entire manuscript, you should make it clear to the examiner (or any other reader) why, out of all potential options, you have taken the particular approach you have. 57.0.4 Removing the contents of chapters to place in the introduction You may decide that some of the contents of (particularly data chapter 1) might be more appropriate if it was moved to the introductory chapter. Before you do this I’d suggest that you discuss it with your advisor. Each of the data chapters should have already been signed off (by your advisor) and so it would be a mistake to start chopping them now without consultation. It is also perfectly legitimate to refer in the introduction to a section of the thesis where a particular topic is dealt with in detail. If you are unsure, you’d best be advised by your advisor. 57.1 How long should the introductory chapter be? This is probably the most common qestion I get asked, most often by students that have only days left in which to write it. Obviously, there is no simple answer (just as there is no particular length required for a PhD). Typically, I would suggest that the introductory chapter be longer than any of the introductions to any of the data chapters within your thesis, but not longer than the data chapters themselves - unless you’ve managed to pull off a stand-alone review. "],["PhDconc.html", "Chapter 58 How to conclude your PhD 58.1 Using the funnel structure 58.2 What to include in the concluding chapter? 58.3 Concluding section", " Chapter 58 How to conclude your PhD By the time you come to write your concluding chapter of your PhD, you should have written all of the data chapters and the introductory chapter. Firstly, I should congratulate you for getting this far. You’ve almost finished, and there’s just one final push required to complete the document. You are now the best placed person to tell yourself what should be in the concluding chapter. 58.1 Using the funnel structure In principle, you can use the same funnel structure that we described for the discussion as a way of structuring your concluding chapter (see Figure 49.1). This would include starting with a synopsis of what your thesis is trying to achieve. Clearly, this starting section may be more than a paragraph (as it was in the data chapters), and the precise structure will be dictated by the complexity of your thesis structure (Figure 56.1). 58.2 What to include in the concluding chapter? I suggest that you take your conceptual outline (from the introductory chapter), and use this to being thinking about how best to construct the outline of your concluding chapter. If your data chapters are used to feed into a final output, then consider using the approach of a logical argument as the outline. The main body should review the concluding findings of each of the data chapters, and especially the way in which they interact - as these are the aspects that are least likely to have been touched on already in the individual data chapters. It is hoped that the thesis represents a body of work, and not a series of unconnected works. Thus your task in this final chapter is to present to the examiner (and any other reader) exactly how the chapters fit together into a body of work. Your concluding chapter should provide all of the highlights and insights that have been gained from your PhD thesis. It is unlikely that you need to dwell on individuals caveats from the chapters, unless there are general caveats from your approach that span chapters - in which case, these probably deserve attention. Your concluding chapter will cite the data chapters of your thesis quite heavily, as it essentially pulls them all together, along with the objectives that they aimed to achieve, in the overarching concepts of your study area. You also have an opportunity to point to where, in your opinion, the direction of your particular field should move next. Do provide your opinion. Remember that you are now one of the most qualified people in this particular area to be pronouncing on what should be done. Your opinion is therefore valid, and your concluding chapter is a good place to provide a reasoned argument about your own ideas. 58.3 Concluding section Your PhD may not have one overriding simple conclusion, indeed it will likely not have, so don’t try to force one if there isn’t one. Instead, attempt to sum up your findings in a way that explains how they have added to and changed the existing body of knowledge in your subject area. "],["formatting.html", "Chapter 59 Formatting your thesis 59.1 Must do check-list before submitting your thesis: 59.2 Mistakes people make:", " Chapter 59 Formatting your thesis Let’s face it, after spending so much time writing your thesis, having it formatted so that it looks very smart for submission is gratifying. If you chose Bookdown or Thesisdown to write your thesis in, then you’ll simply be able to download the correct style file (cls) and bibliography formatting file (bib) and press the build book button in RStudio and you’ll have your formatted thesis in the time that it takes your computer to render the pdf. You’ll still need to look through it and make sure that the output is what you want. For other, mere mortals, using word-processing packages, you will likely need to invest a lot more time trying to pull together the chapters of your thesis into the correct format. (I’d suggest that right now is not the time to learn Bookdown - unless you are way ahead of schedule!) Try to make it a fun event by listening to your favourite music (very loudly) or having some of your banned tipple (do both if you dare!). It doesn’t require the same level of creative concentration required when writing your thesis, but it does need great attention to detail. Be patient and don’t try to build mega-big files in word-processing documents, as they tend to crash. Instead, copy the template file and compile one chapter at a time, placing them together only at the end for a final build. Your university will have its own stipulation for exactly how they want the thesis formatted. Here, I provide a check-list for the last things to do before you submit. The chances are that your university will have a bunch of helpful links. Make sure that you follow the guidelines of your own institution well in advance of submitting your thesis. 59.1 Must do check-list before submitting your thesis: The following points are based on what may irritate or annoy your examiner (and you really don’t want to do that!): Spell check - yes, it sounds obvious but doing a final spell check is a good idea. Not only this, but take the time to have your word processor ignore or add all of the special words (e.g. species or site names) that it doesn’t otherwise recognise. This will ensure their consistency throughout (within and between chapters). Make sure that your language settings are set to ‘UK English’ (or the English setting for where you are based). Look out especially for words that have different accepted spellings like those ending in -ise or -ize. Decide which you want and be consistent. Consistency is king! But it is often a point where students fail to notice that they have used different styles in different chapters - especially when these have already been submitted or published in journals. Even if chapters are already published, you do need to have your thesis as a consistent document. The same spelling (e.g. UK or US - not a mix) The same species names and taxonomy The same formatting Although this sounds obvious, it’s consistently one of the most common errors Capitalisation of common names, place names and not adjectives. For example, ‘South Africa’ has two capitals, but ‘southern Africa’ only has one. Grammar check - always good to take a final look, especially for chapters that you wrote some time ago. Use the word processor automated options to help you. Have your computer or another device read the text so that you can hear anything obviously wrong. Pay attention if you have used ‘we’ or ‘I’ and make sure they are consistent in your thesis. As a rule, I encourage ‘I’ in a thesis, unless the chapter is also a manuscript, in which case ‘we’ is correct. Page layout. Really important to get this right in your template. Make sure that your template has: Correct paper size (A4 and not US letter - or visa versa!) Margins Line spacing Page numbers Line numbers (really helps your examiners) Headers and Footers. If you can manage a chapter specific header, it’s useful to show your name and a short chapter title. Sections and subheadings. I’ve encouraged you to use subheadings throughout your thesis. Here you have a chance to number them sequentially. This is very useful for your examiners and may be a requirement for the university. Using the word processor’s built in functions will make this task consistent and easy. I dislike writing within a formatted document (as word processors can start getting weird), so my preference is to cut and paste written text into a template at the end. Remember to give them a check through before handing it in. If you’ve done the sections correctly, then the contents page will come out correctly. Title page - prescribed very strictly by the university. The librarians place a watermark after final submission to the library. It may be tempting to change your title now that you know what’s in the thesis, but many universities have strict policies about this. If you want to change the title, make sure that you are able to do so. Content page - word processors can do this automatically if your thesis is formatted correctly throughout (see sections and subheadings above). You can check this to make sure that you’ve done all of your sections and subheadings correctly. Acknowledgements - this is your time to say thank you to all the special people that have helped during your study. There are probably more than you realise, but in addition to your friends and family (who most people don’t forget), think about the people who administered the work, lab mates (past and present) who were always there to help, and people who gave permission at study sites. Check that you provide links to any online repositories of your data. References - probably one of the most dreaded sections of any thesis preparation, but they do have to be done. If you’re one of these people that has everything in a database, then you’ll be laughing or cursing your database throughout. While it might be tempting to only look through the data within the database, spend some time to see how it’s displayed in the thesis. A mistake in the reference database will be multiplied many times in the thesis. Remember that examiners love to take a random look through the reference section to make sure that it’s all good. After years of painfully entering references themselves, they know just what to look for. 59.2 Mistakes people make: Other than the obvious things, all mentioned above, here are some of the mistakes I’ve seen. Submitting the wrong version (yes, this does happen!). Probably worse if having a mixture of right and wrong versions for different chapters (worse because it takes longer to sort out). Last-minute additions to text with incorrect spelling and or grammar. Two correctly spelled synonyms sitting next to each other when only one is desired (probably came about when editing). Forgetting to check for plagiarism. Comments and or edited text (especially when it’s marked as being by someone other than the student). Page numbers that start again and again at different sections. Lots of blank pages or spaces (avoid blank pages if you can, and try to limit the amount of blank space (never &gt;half a page). Leaving important people out of the acknowledgements (e.g. advisor, administrators, funders, etc.). "],["publish.html", "The obligation to publish your work", " The obligation to publish your work Now that you’ve submitted your PhD, you still need need to do something with it. For most of you this will be publishing it in a journal of your choice. Publication is important. Here is a list of reasons why you have some obligation to publish the work in your thesis: If your work is unpublished, then it will not be used. Without use, all the work that you put into it falls away. Your published work will become the foundation for future students and academics who are active in your field. This might well be in another country or on another continent. Your work was most likely paid for by tax-payers in the country where you studied. Publishing this work is a way of handing back the value of what you found. If it is published Open Access, the public can also read it for themselves. Other funders of your thesis work may have made publication a prerequisite of the funding criteria. It is hoped that by publishing your work it will become more accessible to the scientific community. By publishing your work you will find that both you, and your work, become known by an international community that may well invite you to participate in the academic process further (Marks et al., 2013). Both inside and outside of science as a career, peer-reviewed published papers are seen as an important accomplishment in addition to the production of your thesis. The work that you have already put into your thesis (especially if you have followed the advice in this book!), will mean that you are close to having chapters that can be submitted as publications. Your advisor and lab colleagues who helped with your thesis work may depend on your publications. There is a lot of satisfaction to be had by seeing your work published. It has been argued that this depends on who you are and where you come from (Husemann et al., 2017). The satisfaction of having someone say how enjoyable or inspiring your work is to read will certainly not be as frequent as if you managed to publish a novel or newspaper column. But when it does happen, it will bring a smile to your face. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but I hope it will give you some insight into the importance of publishing your results. To counter this assertion, please be aware that there is also research that suggests that publication driven science is not healthy, and that we need a new paradigm to motivate science (e.g. Stergiou &amp; Lessenich, 2014). Indeed, it has been suggested that the ‘publish or perish’ mentality of academia has resulted in the retention (and even deterioration) of poor experimental design, and hence higher false positives in the behavioural sciences (Smaldino &amp; McElreath, 2016). However, before you can join the debate about the future, I’d argue that you need to provide your credentials for the present. Taking your work to the next level is not a trivial step, even though you already have your chapters written in the style of manuscripts. The challenges of publishing work, like other challenges in academia, are much easier if you possess inside knowledge of the system. The demystification of the next steps along the road in academia is the subject of another book.

The modern thesis is usually made up of a series of studies, each of which can be submitted for publication in a scientific journal, but that are related through a logical framework. Later, in Part III, I will discuss the importance of your thesis conceptualisation and how this can be used to pull your chapters together into a coherent argument. This idea of a ‘coherent argument’ is at the heart of the history of the term thesis, which was defined by Aristotle in his treatise: Topica (384–322 BCE). Thesis comes from the Greek word “θέσις”, meaning to put forwards, and referred to laying out an intellectual proposition. Aristotle being the first philosopher to define the word. We have other words that we use for the way in which Aristotle used the word thesis, such as supposition, conjecture or hypothesis. But Aristotle’s use of the word was specifically for the use of a contrary viewpoint to another that was held by the general populous or by another philosopher. Although this historical context appears far from our use of the term ‘thesis’ today, you can still see how a modern thesis is used to test previous general assumptions or specific viewpoints. In the same way that the original thesis argued the case against these views, a modern thesis holds them up to greater scrutiny, and then through a set of inductive reasoning, discusses the veracity of their validity. Perhaps more importantly, the history of the term stresses how the thesis needs to come together into a conherent synthesis that can be presented to an audience. From the origin then, a thesis was a coherent concept, and not a set of related ideas or findings. In the same way, your thesis needs to be pulled together to produce a sum that is greater than the constituent parts. Another word that is commonly used is dissertation, and today the terms thesis and dissertation are used interchangeably. However, the origin of the term dissertation is later than that of thesis: Dissertation comes from the Latin word “dissertātiō”, meaning “discussion”. Hence, from the origin of the two terms we learn that the thesis puts forward an concept that may challenge a commonly held viewpoint, while a dissertation is more focussed on discussion of the concept. Perhaps this later term allows for a more balanced and less biased view from the author where the outcome of the study is logically considered against the background of previous findings and thought. Either way, the history of these terms is helpful for you as the author of a thesis in that it helps you see how what you are producing is a synergistic synthesis of studies which produce a coherent and discursive viewpoint gained from your years of scholarly work, and presented to an audience for consideration. 60.0.1 The oldest theses Although we should expect that the libraries at the oldest universities should hold theses from their students dating back to medieval times when the majority of oldest currently extant universities began, this is not the case. For example, at the University of Oxford (established around 1200 but teaching since 1096), the library informs us that they have only been requiring PhD theses to be deposited since 1920, and this did not become compulsary for some subjects until 1953 (see here). Hence, the tradition of keeping theses, and maintaining a resource of the knowledge gained during years of academic study, is relatively modern and certainly within the last 100 years. Prior to these times, PhD theses were submitted to publishers for publication as books, a tradition that continues to this day in some subject areas. Hence, you might be able to find the published version of a university thesis that dates back beyond 100 years, but you won’t know what students worked on what theses where and when. The university thesis as we know it today, is a relatively new concept and does not have the ancient history that we might expect of our oldest scholarly institutions. I find this quite surprising, but perhaps this is just naivety on my part. After all, peer review has only been in existence for for a similar amount of time. Digital (and hence available online) theses have only become a requirement for less than 20 years, and so even my PhD only exists as a paper copy on a shelf in a university library (although I’ll admit that I’ve never looked for it). Perhaps the take home message here is that you should not be too caught up in the pomp that your institution (likely) holds around their great tradition of theses submission. And there is no great reason why we should not evolve and update the PhD thesis that is something more worthy of the 21st Century. 60.1 A modern definition The ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) defines a thesis / dissertation in ISO 7144 as: Document which presents the author’s research and findings and submitted by him in support of his candidature for a degree or professional qualification. (ISO, 1986) The document looks very interesting and has the potential to be of great use especially if you feel that your institution is not giving sufficient guidance in the preparation of your thesis. Most countries adhere to ISO standard (look for your country here). ISO 7144 is, however, secured behind a paywall and therefore not free for you to access unless you want to pay for the privaledge. Yet another example of why paywalls are never a good idea (see Part II). 60.2 Regional peculiarities Wikipedia has a list of how theses differ depending on which country you are in, and even which region of which country (see here). Although this may help you to see how different countries treat the thesis, the best place to look for information on your thesis is the faculty in which you are registered at your own university. Because universities confer the degree of PhD to those who pass their requirements, it is up to each university to provide their particular standards, which are likely to differ between faculties. You should be able to request a guidebook for your own institution from the faculty office or your library. This document should trump any other opinions given to you from others, and you should definitely be using it when it comes to the final preparation of the thesis that you are going to submit for your PhD. 60.3 Final submission It is important to note that your thesis is not finished until you have made the final submission to your institution. This process is normally handled by the library, but you can only receive permission to submit a final thesis after you have undergone the examination process and your faculty’s dean is happy for your final submission. Your university library is the final resting place for your thesis, where it can rest in peace. References ISO. 1986. ISO 7144:1986(en) Documentation — Presentation of theses and similar documents.
